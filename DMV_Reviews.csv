You're on hold for forever and a day and when you do get someone on the phone they are rude and the least helpful. I went in person and was treated pretty badly as well. The woman didn't want to help me and kept playing on her phone. When I asked her for more information she huffed at me rolled her eyes and gave little information. My husband had to practically pry it from her to get what we needed to know. They didn't help me getting any information on a business when I first opened one. They also won't tell you anything is due until it's way too late and your over charged. If you go in too pay they will not give you any cash back so be sure to bring in what you need to pay or they will take all of it.  I get they are there to take revenue from business's but they could be more helpful and not so shady about everything.,1

Young lady at front door was exceptional. Very friend and personable. She actually smiled which I thought was strange because through all the years dealing with MVD I have never seen one employee smile. Also I was in and out in about 10 minutes. Will definitely go back if I ever need to. Thank you,5
"You'll need all your ducks in a row to get much done here.  Everything must be exactly correct or you'll have to come back once it is.  Check all the rules for your transaction before you show up. Lots of financed vehicles still have liens recorded, so bring your *original* lien release letter. You'll wait an hour here each trip.  Online reservations don't seem to work.  Also, this isn't the tax office so make sure you don't wait for an hour only to find out you're in the wrong place. Take a number upon entry and relax, it's gonna be a while.",3

You never have all the items you need to make changes. It seems like you need to go on a fact finding search prior to your visit as not to waste your time. They should be a little lenient on some things since appointments take 2-3 months to obtain. Maybe call people prior to appointments to ensure they have everything they need. Staff appeared to not have much to do at all.  Smh. #wasteoftime,2

You have upheld the perceived image of the DMV! Your apathy is deafening and this is why the public has issues with the rest of us who work in the government sector. I would never be allowed to operate in this manner.,1

You have to get there early when they open and sign up for an appointment time. They will tell you what time to come back for your appointment. They open at 8 am.  I got there at 7:30 AM and there was already a line of six people in front of me and it really grew after I got there.  Staff is friendly and efficient and it was a pleasant experience. If you are getting the real ID drivers license be sure to go online first and get the checklist of the documentation you will need and have that with you. I will definitely go to this location again.,5

Forms such as driver education certificate and drivers eligibility certificate are not the same. My daughter and I was not greeted with any sort of compassion whatsoever.  In fact, the woman was trying her hardest to make us feel bad.  I suppose making others feel bad makes her feel superior. Obviously she feels small in her job and lives a miserable existence.

Hire someone at $10 an hour to answer the phone and service the citizens who NEED that help! Mr. Treadway is not doing us a favor providing solutions, it's HIS JOB.

"Wyandotte County is a joke.  We moved here in 2020.  Due to the pandemic we had to mail our information in to renew/transfer our vehicle tags.  I made sure our new address was on every single page, and even included a cover sheet with every car, vin, tag number and our new address on it.  Was transferring three cars from Leavenworth County to Wyandotte County.  Mailed the papers in around the end of June 2020.  Come OCTOBER 2020, we still hadn't received our renewals.  We did however receive our State Parks sticker (Oh and our check was cashed within a week!!!!) ??  Finally in November they tell me they didn't have record of my new address and I needed to complete another form.  Did that - still took about 3 weeks to get my renewal stickers.  Here's the kicker - they did not send the County sticker (WY) so my plates still show LV even though I'm registered in Wyandotte.  I'm afraid when I go to renew this year, they are going to screw it up again!  It's impossible to talk to a human being.  Other counties in the state are not like this, I don't know why Wyandotte makes it so hard & frustrating on it's citizens.",1

Nope!  there must be a camera in parking lot because I was greeted by security which let me know I was in employee lot and could be towed if I didn’t move it. He also instructed me on how to drive around the block to to get to the other side of the building where the larger parking lot is for customers.

"WOW!! Best experience I’ve ever had at a BMV. Our family has moved to 4 diff states in the last 10 years. Extremely organized and the office had the best positive energy.
Nate was awesome to work with. He was very
professional and personable. I walked away with a huge smile. I highly recommend this location!",5
"WOW! What a pleasant experience I just had with Nataly! She was very thorough, efficient and friendly! Her customer service skills definitely deserves recognition! From the moment I walked up to the counter she extended a warm greeting and apologized for the wait while she sanitized the counter. She  was  friendly throughout the entire process and made what is usually a monotonous transaction feel very comfortable! I walked in a little irritated and walked out very pleased! Thanks for providing such great service! 😊",5

"WOW! This is the second time I've purchased a vehicle and needed to turn the title over to my name.  Last time I went to the place down the road, that place was dirty filled with people, and I was trying to figure out if I needed to write something down or what.... I am SO SO glad that I ended up at River City!!!!!!
Immediately when I walked in the door I could tell this place was miles ahead of the others! It was spotless, there was snacks and coffee!! The Extremely kind lady looked up and said ""someone will be with you in a minute""   Sure enough she hurried with what she was working on and then asked how she could help.  She was very kind and explained things and answered my questions. She even had me double check the info before I left.

"Wow! I think this is my first-ever 100% positive experience at a DMV license plate office! They were safe (all wearing masks), efficient (I only waited about 2 minutes) and accurate with my tag swap - perfect all the way around.
Even if you have to go out of the way a little bit, I highly recommend visiting this office if you have vehicle title/registration/plate tasks to deal with - you'll be happy you did :)",5
Wow! I have been dreading renewing everything. I’m thinking this is going to be a long process. I’m going to forget a document for the compliant license. The employees here made it quick and easy.

I didn't expect such good service.

The lady at the motor vehicle for my tags helped me by looking up my personal property tax.  I showed her my water bill from April 2021 that was paid.  Go figure.

Then I went to pay my July 2021 water and trash bill.  Smooth as can be.  Change back from my hundred.  Really nice person.

I had a successful experience in the men's room.  Enough about that except it was very clean.

The person taking my 2.00 for parking was nice and wished me a nice weekend.

The reason this is so unusual is it's 16 July and the Cardinals are playing.  It's a total madhouse everywhere else including the streets.

If I need to say it...
I really appreciate it.",5

"Wow the lack of professionalism is astounding.  After witnessing one of the ""instructors"" cross three lanes with no indicator(blinker) as well as over solid painted lines *while on a cell phone*, and politely recommending driving the billboard for the company correctly the driver proceeded to verbally berate me at a red light.  By the way, I AM quite a good driver! (Considering I actually follow the rules of the road by using my blinker, choosing my lane ahead of time to be in it, being  courteous of other drivers) Your condescending tone was a great way to start the day though!",1

"Wow - every gov't agency should be so nice & so efficient all at once! The minute I finished signing in by touchscreen, my turn was called: zero wait time. She zipped through renewing my TDL while being genuinely nice.

Their system of making appointments online is far better than the typical ""cattle call"" most places, private or public, use.

Also seems they hire people who really enjoy being helpful, and then treat them well enough.

Other agencies and some retail outfits we've all dealt with could come here to learn customer service and systems design, in that order.",5
"Would've given 5 stars, BUT upon reaching the front of the line a lady skipped us. She took long with her questions and confusion. With my luck, she happened to have went to the window I was meant to go to with another bout of confusion for the worker. When she was done, I guess the worker assumed she was holder of the number that was called, my number was removed from the queue and the worker went on break. I sat and watched the queue number go up and up without my number being called. Thankfully the worker who handled permit and license photos gave me a quick ticket, though I wish 25-30 minutes hadn't been wasted because of that line-jumper, hope her vacation was worth making people's days longer. Anyways, on the bright side, we arrived around 1:30pm and there was a short line. The first worker we were approached by could've been nicer, thankfully the second worker was extremely friendly. The inside wait time wasn't bad either, the wait time was only about 15-20 minutes. For a first visit it went better than expected, just please punish line-jumpers, they make things harder for everyone there. Edit: Changed to 5 stars then back to 4 stars because I remembered how two workers were passive-aggressive to a Spanish speaking customer and expressed annoyance as she took a vision test. Don't treat people like that.",4

"Would give 1 star if it wasn’t for the short waiting time(appointment was made) & helpful front counter employee. The employee who helped me on transferring out-of-state license has a visible name plate at her work cube(TONYA). She shows big attitude for no reason, making it a stressful situation for me. The whole process has almost zero eye contact. It is as if she hates her job & my presence made her feel worse. Whenever I ask a question or answer to her question, she showed a judge-mental look. I can hear and feel from other cubes that all the employees are super friendly although they are short in staff, all present customers were having a pleasant experience from it, except for me obviously.

I went to this dmv a couple days back for the same reason, their system was down & the employee at the moment gave me options: 1)stay & wait then try again 2)come back later & I do not have to get a new number 3)come back another day. I waited for another 30mins & the system was still down. I left & later that day I tried to call just to check if the system went back to normal. The call was automatically disconnected (few attempts before this led to the same result).",2

"Worth the money & your time . They work with you on your schedule . Nothing is rushed .. Everybody is professional and makes you feel motivated enough to get out there & face your fears and learn how to drive .. everything is like baby steps .. you have your videos , your practice tests , your drivers Ed book to prepare you for your test to get your permit / DL.. & then it’s hitting the road which is the fun part & learning the correct way as many times as it takes until you get it right & get comfortable.

After waiting at least 30 minutes, talked to the supervisor who came from inside and she agreed that no proof of insurance is needed for that license. I had to take 5 hours off from work.  Many cases had the same issue of getting wrong information. They need to have a training sessions instead of misleading people and making longer lines.",1

"Worst experience
This covid situation is the worst thing that has happened as it pertains to service. Everything has to be done with an appointment and appointments are spread out over months. You are no longer allowed to just asked a simple question you need an appointment to ask the question. Elderly people are being turned away even though they show apparent disabilities and told also to make an appointment. Some look as if they may not live to make it to the next appointment but the obese city worker don't care because they're just walking around eating and telling people to stand in line to make an appointment. This was the worst experience I have had in the past month with dealing with the Texas Department of Public Safety. And then there are all of the police officers standing around also obese conversing and eating waiting for you to get the slightest out of line or upset and disgruntled so they can have a reason to tackle you so they can say they've done a jobs day work.

"Words cannot describe how grateful I am to have walked into Mr. Everett's office!
I recently moved to Baltimore and I was clueless to the process of getting a car here. I told him that I was about to buy a car and I needed some information on what to do. He kindly explain to me what a title should look like and if I had any more questions to let him know. If it wasn't for him explaining that to me, right now I would have bought a car that I would not be able to drive. I was very stressed out I called him again and he made it possible not only for me to get a car but also my tag and title the same day! I left his office with tears of joy! I cannot thank him enough for his amazing customer service! HIGHLY RECOMMENDED 😊",5

With an appointment you are still going to wait an hour. Without an appointment it may be 4 hours which is ridiculous. It does not take that long to renew a dang license and the permit test is on a kiosk. Please help me understand why they are so slow.

Not to mention she was on her phone most of the time. I think it could run a lot smoother if they hire people that actually want to be there.,1

"Window 5, Patty E. (I think that's her name, initials are P. E.) should be fired after the way she spoke to me. Shame on her managers for allowing her to talk like that to people. I was harassed about being a couple minutes late for my appointment (their Kiosk is confusing so it took longer to sign in), she was incompetent at giving directions for getting a drivers license, and her tone of voice when speaking to me was utterly repulsive. These people actually get paid for this quality of work? That fact disgusts me. I told the woman directly that she was being extremely rude, you know it's bad when the people at the window next to you even chime in and agree the associate is being extremely rude. It was obvious to everyone there the way she was speaking to me was unacceptable under any circumstance, but when I am paying the state and in turn paying her wages, I see no justification for it at all. You should treat everyone with respect unless given a reason not to, I was treated and spoken to with disrespect the second my appointment started until it ended. If I was her manager and witnessed that behavior, I would have fired her on the spot and I have 4 years of managerial experience. I would never pay someone for that kind of performance, ever. Unacceptable, uncalled for, and shameful. I hope she loses her job for acting like she did! I will NEVER go back to this location and I will share my experience with anyone looking for a driver services center! I will always remember the name of the person too! Easily the worst experience I've had at a business throughout my entire life and easily the most unprofessional business I have ever walked into!

While we're stood at the counter that's the moment we found out it costs $21.00 for a title transfer. I weren't prepared for it. ""You need to reschedule an appointment and come back"", a female cashier said. We were quite disappointed. The way Secretary Of State has it set up is a huge inconvenience.

"When I got there and enterd with my little sister the lady that greeted us was rude and asking for my car insurance and ID but when I told her I  had to get it from the car she was getting irritated, but we where 1 hour early before my sisters test time. I liked the lady who we had to check in after the first lady but then the driving instructor he looked Hispanic and about late 20s  was rude (Other people I've talked to also said he was rude and very picky). If your going to be doing your drivers test you have to be perfect because the instructor said my sister had to do 3 moves for the 90° parking but she did 5 and then for parallel parking they said she wasn't centered enough. And for there roads I recommend driving here for a few times because some don't have the lining clear. Another thing you just have to perfect your turns. My sister from her last test before this the instructor said she did amazing the only thing is she just had to forcus on was not getting scared to turn left on green lights and other then that she would of passed but he had to tell her to go. All these other probblems this instructor pointed out the first one from Rochester noticed but didn't care because he said every driver does it and only get perfect when they feel comfortable. Recomand doing it in Rochester the people are nice and they are more umderstanding.",1
"When I got in there was no line. But I went in pretty early. Everyone was friendly and quick, the lady worked with me even though my address was originally put in wrong. I had somehow went a whole year without renewing my tabs and she did not require me to pay for the previous year.  Very helpful",5
"When I couldn't renew my tags online,  I went in person, bypassed the line, and used the kiosk and had no problem.  I paid a convenience fee to use my credit card. But does not look like that would apply if using a check or cash  (And yes the machine indicated cash was an option). Make sure you bring your statement with barcode.  From my understanding,  I will use my receipt until stickers arrive in 3 to 5 business days in the mail.",5

"What's this, a five-star review of... a state DMV office?  Sure thing!  These folks deserve it!  Normally a necessary trip to a DMV is the next worse thing to a root canal, but in my experience, Madison West DMV knows how to take care of business efficiently and with helpful good humor and employees who don't come across as hostile robots.  We went in to arrange for out-of-state licenses and auto registrations expecting to spend hours of misery waiting in lines and filling out a million forms and then being told how we didn't bring the right documents.  But with a little planning ahead, we had all the vital paperwork ready to be checked, filled out forms (downloaded) in advance or on the spot, and were done with all our business in under an hour. Well under an hour.  Just before the noon rush, too, which DID feature longer lines but certainly nothing like what I've seen in other cities in other states. Hats off, this kind of service is what we should expect from government but seldom receive.  Deserves recognition and applause; managing a  generally thankless, often tedious job I'm sure,  and dealing with frequently surly citizens.  Compared to most such places, this experience was a breeze.",5

As you can see she continues with her misrepresentation of the facts.  She did notarize our papers and take our money.  I had only returned to ask her a question.  It is amazing how you could not even extend the common courtesy to listen to another human.  You were so defensive that maybe the State to look onto your business practices.  I was not asking you to break any rules but to provide clarity around what you could do.   Your rudeness over took your ability to be respectful to others.

Great Job! I Recommend  this location to any who have had a bad time/experience at a MVD, as this location will change your mind about dredging going to one.",5

"Went there on a Teusday when they were open. Walked through the crowd that had already gathered, and signed in on the paper. Please note, facility is very small -- six interior chairs and multiple outside. One DMV worker there and she handles everything. If there are driving tests, expect to be there longer. One worker means she leaves to do the test with the new driver.

We signed in on the paper in the lobby at 903am and we got our names called at 300pm. The facility closes at 4. Once we were with the dmv worker, she was very efficient and timely. She knows her stuff. She is very restricted by this structure.

Facility needs to only do licenses and not driving tests to be more efficient.

Facility restrictions get 0 stars. Employee gets 5 stars.",4

So I called the number on the machine that said call if you need assistance. The rude person that answered said that the kiosk was 'not online' and that it 'might' be fixed in 20-30 minutes. Overall take away- it is just as inconvenient, time consuming and frustrating as actually going to the BMV office. Thanks Eric!",1

"Went in for my motor cylce testing. The inspector after verifying paper work,  walked with me to the bike for some initial screening for starting the bike, signals, headlights, horn, brakes and stuff. Then he asked me to meet near the testing area. He showed me the box where I will be making 3 consecutive 8s without putting the feet on the ground. He said I will get 2 practice rounds, and then the actual testing round. I agreed. I started the bike, went in for a loop, put the foot down, looked at him, he nodded. Then started again, went in for 2 more loops and then put the foot down, looked at him. He started walking away saying I failed the test. I was like, ""WHAT????"". He said, ""I stopped after 2 loops and hence he is failing me and I am done and I will have to reschedule"". I said, ""I thought the first 2 were practice rounds before the actual testing round starts. He was like ""I am not talking anymore, I am stopping, no more discussions, you can go""... Come on inspectors, have some humaneness and kindness to people who are already coming with a lot of anxiety and don't be rude or be unrealistic.

One more thing to be noted. This was my second appearance. The first time, a different person came, and he marked a box that was much smaller in size than the second inspector this time. There is no consistency. These guys does as per their wish/convenience/ or are they biased to make the test easy vs difficult for different sets of people?",1

Went here today for my tab renewal. The service was fast. I am giving one star for the woman (Vicki) who help me. When she ask if I still lived on the street that is on my license I said yes. She then ask if the address listed on file is not correct. I said no that it is correct. She let out a sarcastic grunt and said so you live  at a PO box. Of course I don’t !  I tried to explain confidentially why I have it this way. It’s  for a reason. And ask to please leave it . I have had a person from the department file it this way. For privacy reasons. It has been this way for 6 years. She just kept saying so do you live at the box. Everyone there could hear the conversation. I was embarrassed. She ended by saying to me I will leave it but I’m going to tag it for review.  She could have just said that in the beginning. Instead embarrassing me as if I’m some sort of con. It’s none of her business.  And should not be allowed to speak to customers this way.,1

The birth certificate that I had was a certified copy with the multicolored validation on it which I received from the vital statistics office in Oklahoma.  Been using this same birth certificate for years for everything else but when it comes to a Real ID it's not good enough. Went to a different tag agency and had absolutely no problems with getting my Real ID using the same birth certificate. This place needs a little bit more training when it comes to verifying birth certificates because there is absolutely no reason for anyone to have to get the run around just to get an ID,1

"Week 2 of this mobile DMV not being able to process the paper work for and enhanced license. Last week the camera went down and a tech was supposed to come out. They dudnt know when or if he would get there that day. They also didn't know if when the tech did show up, if he would even be able to fix the problem. 2 weeks wasted on trying to get this done. What's the point of the mobile unit if it never works? I thought this was for convenience?? What a huge waste if time. Get it together!",1

We’re property investors and trying to get a hold of the treasury department by phone is impossible - we’ve been on hold for hours and they never pick up. Sure you can blame Covid and “working from home” but they must lack serious leadership in that department.  The staff is highly unmotivated to work.  I feel for them because behind closed doors I wouldn’t be surprised if there’s some major issues and strife happening at the treasury department.,1

One of the greatest improvements is that they have a check in desk, and they are able to go through your documents and determine their sufficiency before having to wait for your number to be called and discovering you don’t have what is needed. Today’s check in person was Jackie and she was outstanding. Very helpful, knowledgeable and efficient with your time.. hope she is there when I have to go back in April.

The person assisting me at MVD Express proceeded to tack on late charges without even pointing this out to me? She completed the entire transaction, THEN and only THEN was I given an itemized statement to see the charges. I explained I could not bring in a title I did not have? I asked my late fee be removed. They simply stated they would reverse the entire transaction, not refund the late fee. I will now take it up with the state of NM. The State is also behind, we got a new truck, made application with the state of NM with the dealership, registration and plate did not come for 7 weeks! So MVD Express knows the state is behind, yet tacks on the late fee?",1

May 16,  It has been four weeks since I posted this.  I would appreciate a response .  The TDOT truck continues to be parked in the cove.

So far we've used this office to obtain licenses or IDs for 60 people so I'd say I have a pretty good idea of the general experience one should expect to have here.

Overall the service that we receive here is excellent, bordering on exceptional, at least for government standards. Every clerk that we have spoken to wants to help genuinely and is not miserable to deal with. There is one lady up at the front that asks people if they have an appointment or not that is particularly troublesome. Aside from that we have enjoyed working with this DOL branch and very much appreciate their assistance.",4

Then he asked the second guy what they were doing and he wouldn't say a thing and just walked right past him. After our vehicle didn't pass smog because a check engine light was not lighting up they said they couldn't find one so knowingly failed our car and charged us the $21.95.

We have always had good experiences at this tag agency. The owner is great and so are the staff.

Of the nine, seven of them also have some sort of specialty plates so that means I have some sixteen transactions in a normal year at this tag agency...

I have not once in the past 13 years using the Goldsby Tag Agency had or witnessed anything less than outstanding customer service there... Heading in this afternoon to pick up six annual renewals that I dropped with them late Saturday morning...

They also took care of my wife's real ID on relatively short notice when her regular license was nearing its expiration several months ago... As long as I live anywhere near the Goldsby Tag Agency they will have my business... No online renewals, no other tag agencies, nothing, nada!!!",5

It turned out we were the first passports they had done since the pandemic hit. It was the first day they were doing them again. Everything went perfectly. They were very through and professional.

We broke down on the side of Hwy 22 and Chad Bishop F11 with Mississippi highway safety patrol came to help after we called because we were nervous about being broken down so close to the highway with 5 kids in the car. He got to us very quickly and had a wrecker come help and then followed us to the gas station to make sure we were good. He was very friendly and helpful and entertained the kids while we waited. We are so grateful for Mr. Bishop and his professionalism and kindness.,5
"We asked on the phone what we would need to get our permit and the young lady up front said all we need is just our tip card.  That was a lie you need your birth certificate, tip card, and security number.  Drove 45 minutes for a waste of time.  Never going over there again.",1
We arrived at dmv @ 9:30am to take care of a mistake they made on my paper work 2 weeks ago. Spoke with lady and they got paper work corrected. Then I received a number and I waited 3 1/2 hours before I was called up to one of three windows that were open. I counted the number of people waiting there was at the most 27 people waiting in lobby. There was no people coming in they had 4 people sitting at information desk. They need to use their employees more efficiently. They are very very nonprofessional !!,1

"We are still in a pandemic and there’s no way to social distance at this  location. They don’t have chairs to sit in and I saw a young lady on crutches standing against the wall waiting. No one wiped the counters or pens with disinfectant wipes. The staff is protected behind plexiglass but what about the customers?
Even though the staff was friendly I won’t be back until this pandemic ends.",2

"Way better service than going to 28th Street.  I didn't wait ten minutes and I'd come prepared with my Kindle just in case.  I wasn't at the counter five good minutes and I was done/gone.  The kicker was that people actually smiled, we're polite/professional and made honest to God eye contact!!  Definitely going here from now on, it's worth it to pay for parking just to actually meet state workers who provide a good service in a professional manner.",5

"Was told it was an hour long wait which is fine. Would've been at least two had I stayed, which is fine I don't mind waiting but people who were there before me were being served. Lady in charge of putting names in didn't seem to know what she was doing and couldn't answer a simple question about an accurate ETA of when I would be helped. They should move renewals and name changes online so they would have time for all the driving tests put ahead of those who had been waiting patently. Had to leave as I would have been late to work after wasting my time for a service I didn't receive. If you are on a time crunch, don't plan on coming here and getting what you need done. You'll never make it in time. In fact, better clear up a whole day to be able to get what you need done here.",1

I even showed them a confirmation and DOL website that shows my current address (I did 2 years ago). I also had my last years tabs sent to my current address.They said I still had to pay an additional $13.75 for lost tabs, even though it wasn’t my fault (system glitch). Would of been better for them to cover the $13.75 and I would of been a happy customer. $13.75 isn’t a big deal, it is just the part that it was their fault and chose not to cover the cost.",1

Was a quick trip. Only issue was that I didn't really approve of the security guard and how he was talking about a young lady and her attitude during a conversation with a gentleman in line. Or the other security guard who looked like he'd rather be a lifeguard on duty during shark week. Both of them definitely killed the good vibe of Friday.,4

Waited an hour and 15 minutes for a new car title. They had four total people working: three of them doing car registrations and only one of them doing titles. Plus one couple was missing paperwork and information and went in and out and back-and-forth from the desk multiple times which was very annoying. So my line was super long and always moving slow. Please have more desks open with people who know how to do titles. Once you get up to the desk the people are nice and make sure you have all the information you need. Be sure to bring all your necessary documents and you will not have to go back out to your car.,3

"Visiting the Essex MVA is a typical MVA experience. I was going for an ID renewal so it wasn't the most complicated transaction. Checking in with security to confirm your appointment goes quickly. The line to get your number after that was slow at first because they only had a single station open, but after about 15 minutes, they opened another and it was smooth sailing. Everyone was kind and courteous. It's worth noting that I arrived early, but I left about 30 minutes after getting my number and there was no longer a line at the counter.",4
"Visited today at 1:30 and was done by 2:15 pm..... very
courteous, friendly and professional staff, well organized !",5
"Visited today and I must say it was a substantially improved experience from before. Had an appointment for license renewal, was in and out within 20 mins. The staff was courteous and I was clearly guided where needed. Refreshing change from the long queues and unfriendly interactions. Kudos!",5

"Visited this DMV location today. Yes, I did wait in line for an hour but this was due to customers being unprepared or just not having a clue.

They definitely went above and beyond.",5

Vip auto in Rochester is awesome and I highly recommend going there for all of your car troubles.

Huge hugs to Crystal and the gang of VIP!! 😊😁🤗,5
"Vicky, Sherri, and the whole ABC Title team in Harvey where so helpful titling and registering my vehicle after an out of state purchase.  Even in the wake of hurricane, they began assisting me as soon as their doors reopened.  I was still located out of the state, but they were super helpful in letting me know what documents I needed to send them in order for them to complete the transaction and get my vehicle registered/titled and returned it all back to me.  Very accommodating and a pleasure to work with.  Have used them a bunch and would highly recommend. Thanks for all the help!",5
Vicki was fantastic - incredibly efficient and helpful! I’d recommend this DMV simply because of her! Thank you for making our experience a good one!,5

"VERY VERY good service here! I had to register my vehicle from out of state. They were able to review my documents, and get my registration and license plate within 20 minutes.

I recommend arriving an hour before closing to ensure you have sufficient time to get your vehicle registration. And ensure that you have done your Texas Safety Inspection.

Yes, you will pay some money to get it done here. But the additional fees are worth it for the convenience and quick service!",5
Very useful to contact to get a quick answer on the roads' conditions!,5
"Very unprofessional.   Poor signage.  When you walk in the door,  you don't know to which side of the room to get your needs taken care of.   The staff are slow and a little rude.  They don't appear to like their jobs or people. Several interactions with international people showed a lack of awareness regarding how to simplify or even change their usual verbage.  Everything about the setup and process needs to be reassessed for a greater effectiveness.",1
Very unprofessional people working at this location. One woman has the worst attitude when I come to her booth for assistance. This place needs to hire nicer and individuals that want to work and be pleasant to residents. This is why I always go to the other tag agencies across town. Do better!,1
Very unprofessional had and appointment to Sign the contract and was blown off due to him being in Raleigh when we had talked says before.  Worst place ever.,1

A little more cheerful & positive attitudes would help. SMILE for goodness sakes! If you hate your job so much leave. I got the vibe nobody there enjoyed what they were doing. Multiple people that came in said they had been calling for days & nobody answered their calls. The reply at the desk was ""we only have  1 phone"" but there were 2 people sitting at the front desk along with 3 other's processing licenses. There could be a LOT more effort made to serve patrons.",2

Very rude people. I had an audit from 2016 that I’ve been paying more than the minimum balance for 6 months straight. I asked for more time because I had things come up and she said no. No wasn’t so bad but the way she said it. I asked her to speak to her boss and I was put on hold and when she came back she said no. I asked to speak to her  boss I was told no. She said she was busy. Every time I call up there I have problems. Her name is Kelly. These people will not work with you and they’ll nickel and dime until you’re done with them.

Very poor service.,1
Very poor service bought tabs online went there to pick them up was told I would be able to just go pick them up and not wait in line not true. Over 20 people in line you can't pick up your tabs anywhere else once you have them delivered there so if you don't have 3 hours to stand in line don't go. They also will not answer their phones once they get busy so they will not give you any of this information I would suggest calling someone that actually answers their phone you might get some better information and service,1

In the 40 minutes in line only 3 people were called in, and there was 3  people working. So apparently each person takes a minimum of 40 minutes to be waited on. There was no sense of urgency to assist customers in an efficient manner.",1
Very poor customer service skills by both employees. One young Hispanic lady with high lights didn't like it when I asked questions. Which don't make sense bc I can't learn if I don't ask questions. And the other young Hispanic lady with dark curly hair in a high bun and skinny was just as rude didn't like us asking questions. We where just trying to gift a vehicle to my father in law. It should have been a happy time. In stead It was made stressfull and a bad experience. Whoever runs this place needs to be in shop more so they can see who they actually have working for them.,1

"VERY pleased! These ladies are totally professional & personable. They had me in tears— literally. Because my usual tag agency (in Norman) couldn’t be bothered with actually helping a client of 20+ years. I walked in here & was immediately greeted & spoken to by all three women. The office was lively, with music & great smelling scents. I voiced what I needed, and explained the dire strait situation (as I had at LaNoy) and was met with overwhelming reassurance that they would work me in, if I could wait. Each customer that walked in, was greeted with the same enthusiasm & courtesy, many by name. I’ve not been taken aback by kindness in a long time and certainly never at a tag agency but, I sure was!
Goldsby Tag Agency —you have my business & all my family and friends will know the few extra miles are worth the drive.

Thank you.",5

You can help by doing yours finding out what you need before you get there, and being polite. When you argue over information you didn't bring you make it longer for the rest of the people who did bring it, so stop whining. Do your research. Bring what you need. Or stay home.

"very incompetent people working here.  I registered my car here last year and before it was approved, I was told 3 different stories by 3 different people working here. ended up running around like a headless chicken doing everything that was told to me each time going back only to find out that what was said was not true ?

finally got my car registered after all the hassle. ok now waiting for title to be printed. during that time I relocated to different state, still no title received. finally got ahold of a rep at NC Raleigh DMV to find out that’s going on with title o LG to be told there was a hold on the printing due to mistake on the registration paperwork !!!

called this location to fix the issue as my registration was expiring the following month, only to be given the run around by the man that works there. He told me TWO completely different stories and honestly did not know what he was talking about. Now why would 1. My paperwork be approved and my car registered if everything wasn’t sound and correct on the paperwork initially? Shouldn’t the workers here be knowledgeable and COMPETENT enough to know how the paperwork is to be correctly filled out ? 2. Why am I being given the runaround from someone working there who clearly doesn’t know how to help ? Just blabbering on and on and confusing me and himself while looking at the paperwork and flat out telling me to to the complete wrong thing that would have caused more trouble and wasted time that I clearly did not have !!!!!!

they do not know their stuff in that building so make sure you have all paperwork looked over by someone competent before going to them. honestly, go to another location if you can because you will be so frustrated with the poor skills here.",1

"Very horrendous experience. Was turned away without even looking up my name. Call the Lincoln dmv they tell me in already clear to renew and they didn't know why the one in Kearney would turn me away. So I asked at Kearney and the supervisor, I'm guessing, immediately got up and threatened me with police and proceeded to have a sheriff enter the dmv. This is a clear use of intimidation when exposed for not actually doing the job they are supposed to.",1

"Very greedy and dishonest.  My registration cost $54 and after their charges it cost me $121.  That is over 100% mark up in fees. You do not have to do a VIN inspection, I had a certified odometer and vin form.  It is dishonest to do extra unnecessary services, that were not requested or required, so you can change money for it. I verified with the Albuquerque MVD that doing a Vin inspection the way this guy did is absolutely not required or necessary. He did this just to charge me more money. It is so sad that we live in a world where people are dishonest just to be greedy.",1

"very friendly staff, quick and small waiting time, However i renewed my license in 2019 to a class 'E', thinking everything is good until i tried to down load my license onto LA wallet, The bar code on the back of my license will not transmit. said my license is out of state code. after working with LA wallet, ( phone calls, email, text, etc) they said i have to go back to OMV, Since Express office issued me my license i figured i would go back to them, after visiting them x2 i was told they did nothing wrong and they are an independent business and i need to go to a state owned OMV, the only thing they would do is re issue another license for another $40.00. my guestion is how do i know the new license works. so my advice is for everyone scan your license on the back barcode before you leave the office. very important for the bar code to work if you travel to check in with the airlines",1

I just moved here from a different state and went to get a state ID.

I had to tell her driver license is my ID and why are you cancelling my driver license and just giving me an ID and after that she was like okay I will give you a driver license. Another thing is even after telling her my different state situation, she issued us a non federal ID. State laws in the state that I’m from is different and even after explaining a situation she didn’t even bother to ask me about the types of ID. I found the differences from my friends and family. Very disappointed, I wish I remembered that person’s name who helped us but she was white and skinny woman.

Review before the pandemic:
My preferred DMV office because the one at 34th street is worse. Arrived at noon and took me almost 3 hours to get a real ID. The staff and security officers were very nice.

You don't necessarily need to upgrade to Real ID. The regular one can still work now and in the future. The most noticeable impact will be that you need a Real ID to board a domestic airline.

If you rarely travel domestically, and rarely need to go to federal building, you don't have to be in the office to get a real ID, or at least you can wait until maybe after 2020 to  do the upgrade. If your regular ID is expiring you can just renew it online or mail without physically be in the office.

In October 2020, Real ID will be needed ( or passport) to board the domestic airline, and that is why recently until October 2020 is the 'rush hour'  for Real ID application.

I really love that the security officers kept saying thank you for your patience. It helps a lot keep everyone saint during this terribly long waiting time. Oh, well, at least we can sit. Those officers who help guiding the crowd were standing all the time.",4

"Trying to get my driver's license after moving from Pennsylvania, this has been more difficult than necessary. During the first appointment I was told I needed my divorce decree to prove that I was no longer married, but have kept my married name. That's understandable. I asked if that would be all I needed, and was told yes. At the second appointment I was told that I needed to provide my marriage certificate because my current name and other documents don't match my birth certificate (well, yeah...)

Better communication would be great, if I was told that I needed both documents I would have brought them to avoid having to make a third appointment. It wastes not just my time, but the time of others.

She said nope we don't do that here so I had to drive all the way to Michigan to get this done and they said they didn't know why she sent me away but whatever. Called to see if I could come in this time and get what I need done and I didn't even get to finish asking my question she just interuppted me mid asking saying I need to go to a title place. I tried to ask my question 3 times and she interuppted me every time. (Same blond woman from before) I'm sure based on the reviews she's this Riley person.

Once I walk in (as I was told I could do) THEN they inform me they cut off certain services after a certain hour. I would say that's important information to provide someone somewhere between ""have you been married with a name change"" and ""you'll need two forms of ID and mail to prove residence"" Get yourselves together, man.",1

The next available date is sometime in October, which I can't make due to joining the military, I will be at basic training. Confused why that is the next available date considering there was almost nobody there taking the test when I went.

Also, no one really likes going to the DMV, but I will say that I've often had good experiences at this location (compared to DMV experiences in other states). The Maplewood office isn't that large, but they have good ""open"" hours and it's usually pretty quick and painless (as long as you pick your time right!).

"To be plain - do yourself a favor and go to a different DMV in RI.

Pros: The employee that I spoke with was pleasant and helpful, and she took care of me with a great attitude and a friendly demeanor.

Cons: Quite literally - everything else.

There is also no parking (save 2 handicap spots in front of the building), so anticipate that you will need to park down the road and hoof it back to the building.

They call people at a rate of about 4 ticket numbers per hour, so be prepared to wait of MANY hours - I was ticket 22, and I waited for just under 5 hours for a new license. There is also no parking (save 2 handicap spots in front of the building), so anticipate that you will need to park down the road and hoof it back to the building. The DMV services are on the second floor of the Westerly Town Hall, so the ""line"" to just get your ticket very awkwardly snakes up 2 flights of stairs from the Town Hall entrance. The seating arrangement faces a massive blank wall, away from the screen with the updated ""now serving"" numbers. The air conditioning was blasting so hard that my teeth were darn near chattering for the duration of my wait.

There is a sign at the front of the waiting area that simply states ""NO FOOD OR DRINKS ALLOWED"" ... for a 5-hour wait, I expect to get wined and dined, never mind having to sneak sips from my water bottle. (I have no idea what someone with dietary restrictions or diabetes would have to do.)

The next time the DMV is unavoidable, I'm going to South County. My mistake this time, but lesson learned.",1

"To anyone who needs to come here: MAKE AN APPOINTMENT! You’ll be put in line right away. If you don’t make an appointment, you have to wait outside (in the heat!) for the people who have appointments to go first.

There is a decent wait depending on time (my appointment was at noon and I just finished at 1 pm). I think that pretty much all the issues could be solved by hiring more people. There’s 1 greeter who helps you check in and makes sure you have everything you need, and 2 ladies at the main counter. They’re doing their best but of course they need to take their time with their work (obviously official documents etc. need to be carefully made) and deserve breaks, so having more employees would be great for everyone.",4

Excellent, thank you!",5

"Tip if you are taking a written license test here: Once you have passed the exam, DO NOT queue again to finish the paperwork - go 5 mins down the road to the Saint Paul License Bureau on 200 University Ave. I waited almost two hours and still had 9 people ahead of me in the virtual queue (started at 30 people).

"This will probably never be read by the manager or someone in customer service but I will write this email anyway.

I want to relate my negative customer service of today August 31, 2021.

I have used your service for many years and return again and again because of the good service.  I will never return after today.  I will take my business somewhere else.

I arrived at about 2:30 pm trying to get my ODL renewed.  I waited in line with 3-4 people in front of me for about 20 minutes.  When I was called, I stated that I needed my ODL renewed and the man that works for you stated that he could not renew it today.  When I enquired why he stated that it took 15 to 20 minutes to process each person and that there was not enough time to process mine and if any of those waiting had a problem then it would even be longer.  He then suggested that I drive to Norman.  As I was leaving at 2:50 pm, I noticed there were three people waiting to get processed.  At the rate of 15 to 20 minutes per person that would at least be an hour wait and if you close at 5 pm the the last hour the person processing the ODL would have nothing to do.

I would suggest that you not waste anyones time and from now on put a sign on the door stating that you were not processing anymore ODL for the day. If a sign would have been posted on the door I would have not waisted my 30 minutes only to be notified that I could not be processed.

Sincerely,

Brad W. Townsend",1

"This was my first time doing business with Seattle Auto Licensing. This office is GREAT. There were several people waiting in line and my initial thought was “this is going to take a while” that wasn’t the case at all. I was in and out with my car tabs within five minutes. Vicki went above and beyond bringing a scraper outside to help remove my old, built up car tabs that were stuck on my license plate. She also cleaned off my plate with a tissue where the car tab goes. It’s the little things that customers notice that really make all the difference. I could see she was busy answering phones and was even helping to translate for a customer in espanol and she still offered to help me. If you’re in the Seattle area and need vehicle licensing services I highly recommend this office. Thanks again for the speedy and helpful service.

This place will test your patience. Be prepare to get incredibly frustrated and come back for the same BS several times. You will have to skip work and take time off just to take care of anything here. They are incompetent and their system is garbage.,1
This place will most likely waste your time. Not only was the customer service horrible and covid guidelines not being followed but they where simply unable to help me. After four days and multiple phone calls back and forth between them and my lean holder I was informed that their computer and printer are not hooked up so they cannot email request for customer titles. They also did not attempt to call me back to inform me that they where unable to do this. I wish I had read the other reviews earlier. Honestly don't understand how this place is still in business.,1

This place was right on time!! The we’re open on the weekends which accommodated my crazy schedule! I worked with Nancy while I was there and she was personable and professional! My plates came in only two days!! I recommend if you need quick and efficient service this is a place to try.,5
This place was really really busy it's hit or miss when you come in I would suggest anything that you can do online do online because it is not a fun place to go it's almost as busy as a social security office if that gives you an idea. It is clean they do have employees that are nice. For the most part it's not a bad place but if you can do it online do it online,3

This place was fine. It's everything that you would anticipate from the DMV. My current  favorite part of my experience is the gentleman behind me that thinks we all appreciate his music. Perhaps he has never heard of headphones. This is everything that I hoped it would be from a government office. It's clean and doesn't smell bad. I won't return until I need to.,2

This place was busy as soon as opening at 8am. Line were extremely long but I got in pretty fast. Mrs. Charlotte was a sweetie. The other ladies seem to be nice as well trying to help everyone.  Some of the customers are rude,5
This place was awesome. We had  major confusion with our title from another state and registration as well and they got it straighten out with no issue....,5
This place was awesome.  Everything that we try it was great.  The service was fast and awesome and the food as well. Not too much parking surrounding but there's a parking lot not too far and it's a flat rate wich is a plus.,5
This place was awesome when I had to take 4 test. I failed 2 and passed 2 and they gave me a book to study for the next 2 tests. Love it here and I am going to bring my son for his Permit!!!,5

The woman issuing the license was friendly, personable, knowledgeable, fast efficient and professional. Good bye Affton license bureau where I was treated badly on more than one occasion.",5
This place was AMAZING!! I will go to them for all my DMV needs from now on! Not only were they way less than other places (flamingo and Durango tried to charge me $900 for a rapid title and this place was only $130 and I had my title in 2 days!) they were live savers for me! I really needed to get my car’s title in my name and they got it done! The address is a little confusing but once you find it it’s all great! Great service! I seriously appreciate these guys so much!!,5
"This place was a little hard to find. You have to drive past the Motor Vehicle Commission and make a left onto almost an abandoned looking road that will lead you to the entrance.

They are friendly, helpful and get you in and out quickly.  They accept credit and debit cards as well, with no additional transaction fees.",5
This place needs to be either shut down or totally revamped. Two months to make an appointment but only 1-2 people working there. A place that is supposed to serve the public seems to want to make it as difficult as possible to get services. It is run down and has a negative vibe. Save yourself time and hassle and just pay a private company to do the test with them.,1

I got there 30 minutes prior to closing having to transfer my driver's license from out of state and I was sure they were going to turn my away because there wouldn't be enough time to process my card, but they got it done and my card printed right then before closing. Yay!",5
This place is unique but exceptional!,5
"This place is trash. What's the point of an appointment if I have to wait 45 min and watch people without appointments get served before me? The worst part is the lady who didn't set an appointment just told them she wasn't going home so I guy helped her right away. Then she preceded to tell them that their website didn't say you have to have an appointment.

What's the point of me doing everything correct if I can just come in and be a Karen and get helped right away?

Worst part is I asked someone why I hadn't been helped in an hour and they said ""Seems about right!"" No sorry for your wait or anything.",1

I was apparently standing too close to the desk and was asked, as a high risk pregnant person with gestational diabetes to move into the crowd. When I got here they are calling 124 and I am 183. There is not enough space inside for everyone to distance themselves. Also the point of an appointment is to get in and out in a reasonable amount of time. This is insane up here.",1

They don’t want to get up from their desk and look for anything or ask questions that they clearly don’t know the answer to.  Just because they’ve never come across your particular situation themselves, they’ll tell you they don’t do it.  All of this is to get you to leave.  I knew exactly what I needed and the staff asked another staff member in a leading manner to try to get her to agree.  She did not!  This isn’t the first time they’ve tried to just send me away after wasting my time in line WITH an appointment.  The staff is rude!

This place is a joke. The employees are a joke. They turn people away just bc they can. Took my son to take his permit test I had all the documents except the the birth certificate did not have the parent information on it. I had never noticed it before and I used it for everything else including the school and they never had a problem with it. One of the employees states they let her use her child’s school form for verification so the lady belong me went to ask the manager and he said NO. I asked to speak to the manager he came out I told him what the employee said and he said she was a liar and that never happen. I even had my DOHS form with me stating who my children are and they wouldn’t take anything even after asking me if I had other proof. Ridiculous and this is exactly why all counties should have their own license office. Which they did but the state decided it was better to shut them all down and run every county to Bowling green. People need to start using their brains. Not a good idea at all!!!!!!!!,1

On top of that you cant get your licence plates at the same location, you must travel half way across town.

This is the worst experience ever. They teaches you NOTHING .. you are put in front of a computer screen for hours & is expected to learn something afterwards. They give you a test & you are given at least over 200 questions. Don’t waste your time you won’t learn nothing neither will you ever touch a wheel to drive. This company is very unprofessional. They barely remember your name every time you walk in. Bad area also !! They are only after money .. also the heavyweight lady behind the desk doesn’t even look professional she’s always dressed slouchy. One day she smelled like she had been smoking. All she wants to do is sit behind a desk & pass out unnecessary videos. Whole summer gone to waste .. so don’t waste your time nor money. These people are not right.,1

The woman at the front desk was unfriendly i tried to talk to her hey how ya doing you having a good day she is straight faced and doesnt like to make small talk then forced me to put a mask on when all the other ladies were not wearing a mask in the facility which i have photos of ! this place needs to be shut down they also over charged me from the specific amount the woman told me that i needed.

Get rid of the whole Ferguson License Office Staff and bring back the old office manager, who was better organized and more then capable of running a smooth office.  To show you just how much this office needs help, it was a girl back working behind the counter after she got up and quit and walked off her job while leaving a entire line of customers waiting for drivers. Who in the hell hired her back?? But I guess when the whole office got attitudes this is now acceptable at Ferguson.",1

You need appointments to visit a DMV. This isn't anything new people AND is actually way better than before covid. Most people appreciate this. AND most people appreciate all of you at the Bennington DMV that have to deal with people trying to walk into places that require appointments or trying to please the people that just feel the need to complain about things very loudly JUST to complain. You can't make things up that you witness nowadays...Keep up the good work you guys and gals! AND I'm still laughing about my visit yesterday morning... It was...um...interesting!",5

"This is the reason I often cheat on taxes and fees whenever possible.  ABSOLUTELY HORRIBLE non-existent service, the LAZIEST, mentally challenged employees anywhere!

Most often they will claim their systems are down, try to reschedule your appts, close early any chance they get without notice, leave the phone off the hook or leave you on an extended hold, and flat out deny you service.  Or just try to pass the buck to somebody else.

This is extremely upsetting and saddening, I often find myself pondering the idea of just screwing everybody I come across in my field as well.  I urge anyone who has the chance to screw over these employees and let them feel it!

On the positive side, I have saved A LOT of $$$ figuring out ways to keep it out of the hands of these leeches.  Think about it, and you can too!  I cut back my eating out, cut back at the gas pump, entertainment, buy online, etc., etc.  EASY!

"This is by far the absolute worst group of people posing as an actual Post Office!! Because there's no way an actual Post Office could be horrible. I probably shouldn't even post a review in them because I already have enough of my mail and packages go missing, lost, not delivered or sent back to the shipper. It's their way of retaliation because I told them to take a long walk off s short Pier because I absolutely refuse to pay $40 to get a new key for my mailbox that I didn't want in the first place or rent a P.O. Box for like $70-$80 dollars! Because the last time I checked it cost money to send whatever it is you are wanting to mail but a person shouldn't have to pay to receive standard mail deliveries. So instead I went with a different service they offer which is to put a ""Hold Delivery Service "" on my mail so I could actually receive my mail. But since I went that route I no longer receive my mail because they now just stamp it return to sender and send it back and all my packages get lost magically and the only mail that ever reaches my mailbox these days is either junk mail or weekly advertisement flyers but never anything of importance that's for sure. The childish behavior and preschool shenanigans of the employees at this Post Office have cost me hundreds of dollars, countless tears from my kid when the stuff he ordered never shows up and a great deal of stress. They should be ashamed of themselves for their petty behavior and actions all because I refused to pay for a new key or rent a PO Box from them",1

"This is arguably the worst tag agency in Oklahoma. Never mind the rude staff, it’s kind of expected with these type of places. However, I would caution anyone getting a REAL ID at this location. Not only did I still have not receive my REAL ID yet (11months+ and counting- luckily my driver’s license hasn’t expired), they gave me the go around for months, alternative numbers (DHS)to call, but never mentioned to me that I could go to another tag agency (until today- June 8th) to check on the status of my REAL ID. I understand there was a pandemic and accepted the delay but this was beyond acceptable. Today I was able to check the status of the ID at a reliable location (Northwest Tag Agency) and they were extremely helpful at trying to wave the fee and processed me a new one. Additionally, I had to pay another processing fee because the lady at (Woodcrest) only filed a replacement which had my new REAL ID have an expiration of 7/2022! That means I would’ve had the ID for two years instead if the standard 5.5 years. I’m utterly disgusted that this was never mentioned to me and had to pay the processing fee for a “renewal” today. Lesson learned is to never come here again. $40+ and a whole lot of wasted time was the price I had to pay.",1

They even screwed my plates onto my car !  No need to ever step foot in the DMV !!!  Thank you DMV Services … you guys are awesome !!!,5

This is absolutely the worst branch. we paid a ticket back in April and found out thru our insurance that license was suspended. when we call RMV we end up being transferred to this branch and not only were they the ones that made the mistake. it has been 3 days and the license has not been reinstated. we lost work and is causing hardship. i will be filling a complaint. Absolutely disgusting. Im only giving a star because it does not let me post without choosing a star.,1

"This is a wonderful tag agency! I understand how working with the tax commission and the department of public safety can make things pretty difficult, but this tag agency handles it very well unlike all the others. I appreciate all the work that they put in and how they have to deal with so much on a day-to-day basis especially with the public who doesn’t understand how this system works. I definitely recommend this tag agency more than the others.",5

"This is a very slow location. Off the top of my head, there are three other locations that have this process down to a science.

What would make this location more pleasant:

1) production line. I’ve seen these run before where there are stations that process pieces of the request from the customer

2) there isn’t any displayed queue to know your place in line. It’s a mystery. People are just waiting for hours, literally (yes). And no employees will inform you of your placement in the queue

I’ve never waited this long.

Yes, I checked in online and waited one hour before coming. I am currently one hour standing in the lobby, awaiting my number. I will update if things change, however, I’m guessing I’ll be here another two hours.

Barnes Tag agency researched the issue looked up what requirements I had to fulfill.

This is a government facility owned by the tax payers. The madats in TX has been lifted by our governor yet someone here sees fit to over step hom and require that ppl wear a mask even when a medical condition exists that the cdc says if you have then they recommend you dont wear one. Well I have left a personal message with the governor abbott and will be going to my attorney to see about filing a case as well.  The overstepping of government officials has completely gotten out of hand and if the ppl dont stand up for your right to free movement they will be taken. The reviews on this office are pathetic and the couple of employees here I did speak to should not be dealing with the public as their personal communication skills not only embarrassing but sad to say they represent any county in our state.,1

The first time I was told I needed to have my marriage certificate and all of my other paperwork was good but what they didn’t tell me was that they can print out the marriage certificate in their office for a fee and they also didn’t even let me fully get out my reason for being there. So the second time I went they told me that I needed certified paperwork from NC but still all of my other paperwork was good. I got that and went in today where the lady told me that the paperwork that they said would work for me the first and second time I was there would not. I could tell the first time that I went in that they didn’t have a clue what was going on because the lady that helped me had to go ask about five different people what to do before she came back to me. I would drive 2 hours away to another dmv before I wasted my time at this one again!! It’s trash.,1

I thought their job was to help people follow the laws and register vehicles but I guess I was wrong. The power tripping and flippancy is just abhorrent. Not to mention that I had  to wait a month to just even be able to schedule an appointment and wait two months to get it completely wasted. The employees don't even know what is on their own website.

Just went yesterday and the volume of people there was kind of insane, apparently because everything that wasn't expiring during the pandemic, now people need renewed. Be aware you need to sign up to wait in line, and respond to all the texts you get in order to see your place in line. We signed up, went to lunch, went to the store, and still waited in line for quite a while. Many people did their whole wait out in the heat, some smart folks brought folding chairs. 2 hours 44 minutes was the posted wait for us and we ended up being served after four hours. Also I saw a few people turned away after their long waits because they didn't have the right paperwork - yikes. Make sure you have everything. Be aware they need more stuff now that they're doing compliant licenses so if it's been a couple of years, look up the accepted documents and make sure to bring them. People working there are incredibly slow moving, which doesn't help. But they are nice, and slightly overwhelmed. Patience and kindness help, make sure to block off the day to handle your stuff there, at least for the time being, or you will be frustrated.",4

"This DMV seems to be run pretty well, and I was able to get through the process of getting a new license very quickly and easily. Really, this should be a 5 star review, but I’ve gotta both lmao and take a few stars off for my interaction with the staff at the renewal counter. The person handed me a paper with the information from my previous ID on it, and asked that I review it to verify that it was still true. Admittedly, I skimmed the thing, as my address, eye color, height, etc., hadn’t changed, so I handed it back saying it looked fine. To which, this not real kindly staff member scoffed loudly and said “Really? That’s your *real* weight?” and shoved the paper back at me. Also admittedly, my previous ID had been from 5 years earlier, and I’d probably put on about 10-12 pounds since then. I would argue that getting the exact number doesn’t matter that much, as I’m still quite recognizable by the tiny photo on my ID which doesn’t show the entirety of my body. But, whether it matters or not, I corrected my egregious lie and got my ID without further incident (so props to the staff member on her general efficiency). To me, this is kind of a funny story (although people either laugh a lot or tell me how deeply sorry they are when I tell it), but likely only because I’m not that sensitive about my body (I swear). It was a moment of only slightly wounded pride for me, but it was objectively delivered in a real rude manner, and could’ve been a lot more damaging if years of having three older siblings hadn’t made me mostly impervious to nasty comments. So anyway, fast service, can’t recommend highly enough in that regard, but write down your weight accurately or you will get dragged to kingdom come.",3

Another employee was going to give me a camera card, but she noticed that I already had an old camera card that could still be used. I took my old camera card to another employee who took my photo and printed my new ID. The printer printed an ID with a slightly blurry photo, but I think that is how the hardware and software are supposed to work. The entire process took only about 10 minutes, and it could have gone even faster if I had realized that I could use my camera card past 60 days.",4

The place is run down and not as clean as it needs to be considering we are in a pandemic, but the staff is doing their job processing tasks and seems alert and willing to help.  If this was in Madison, it would be closed for repairs, but since Madison doesn't have to use this inner-city DMV, they probably are not worried about how run down it is getting.  Maybe start by fixing the chairs, replacing the stained carpet, and scrubbing down everything.  The parking lot is pretty rough, too, and the landlord isn't doing anything to maintain that.

"This DMV has someone directing you to which line to go to but she doesn’t answer any of your questions.

So you have to stand in line for 2hrs just for someone to provide you info.

This is just not good customer service.  This DMV should have different employees or privatized to a company that does offer good customer service.",1
"This dmv has got a team of wonderful people right from the old lady at gate to the last service provider. I walked in on a regular day to get a NC driver's license for the first time and they made the process so simple for me. Wasn't even sure I needed an insurance, but they advised me to try call some auto insurance companies. In about an hour, I got my insurance sent in through their fax number. Was so excited I got my driver's license in the next 20 minutes. Ms. Jackson at the front desk knows just what you need. Her customer service is one of a kind.",5

"This DMV facility lacks the means to administer a simple written driver's test. Read that again. With no test, then you can't be helped for any drivers licensing at the brand new DMV location in MN. Why is that allowed to even be a thing in your process, management? The testing location is run at a different site across town, with different scheduling that needs to be arranged. To get a WRITTEN TEST ALL CAPS INTENDED I had to make my first appointment 3 weeks from today. Then I scheduled a parallel appointment at the Moorhead DMV afterword, which puts me into August on the timeline of events to get a paper print off copy of my temp license. In a totally unrelated state like North Dakota you're in and out the door in a matter of minutes with a physical driver's license in-hand.

Also worthy of mention, if you wanted to be issued a ""Read ID"" the identification most would consider to be a ""current"" driver's license, the one the TSA is asking everyone to get for flying, or an Enhanced ID that you can use to go to Canada by land, it's by online appointment only. So don't expect getting the driver's license you want walking in the door. If you make it that far in the process by scheduling weeks in advance for the first appointment then you better do your homework online to get a series of paper documents proving your existence in this world or you'll be sent away again to start all over. Passport, social security card, utility bill, proof of photographic ID, there's about 5 requirements you must meet, so follow a checklist.

The staff was not rude, so -4999 Google stars earned. Worst process I've bared witness to in my entire life. To be this dysfunctional you have to have an entire division of incompetency from top to bottom.",1

They are also beautiful estimating invoice and not adjusting the current reading number, for when you make an estimate payment and then read again, they do not give you credit for your payments that you made in the estimates (this appears to be extremely illegal, it seems that it is appropriation illegal of citizens' money).",1

This company is supposed to be professional and know all about different state dmv.  We sent them three customers work and all of them went on for months- their temp tags expired and we finally had to ask for all of our work back.  When I finally got a hold of someone after unanswered emails and messages the office manager Jessie was condescending and basically called me a liar.  He wasn't even in the office yet he was trying to tell me he had a picture of the title we were speaking about and that it wasn't what I was looking at right in front of me.  His employees Anissa and Amy both are incompetent and my customers have suffered as a result of all of this.  I have now had to rent my customer a car because after two months we still have no registration or title work for him.  When I asked who was the owner I was told Kimberly who isn't there and Jesse.  Stay away at all costs!,1

I found an employee letting someone out the side door & he said that they’ve closed early, & did not have a reason why & also stated that the hours were not updated on the website. It makes it impossible to follow the laws when governmental agencies that my taxes fund, decide when it’s convenient to close before regularly scheduled hours, let alone on a holiday weekend. It’s beyond unacceptable. Thanks to the employees decision to start their long holiday weekend early, I’m now left without any identification.",1

Marcia and her staff are amazing!",5
"This atmosphere is so congested with negative energy from the time you walk through the door. The workers did not display good customer service manners. Seemingly not a heart to recognize this could be them or a family member of theirs. I was mistreated by one of the workers and the supervisor as I like to share Black and totally and she did not care. Her words came across I am superior with a title that clearly has went to her head and not her heart. The reflection of her management skills obvious showed on her staff as well ! There was a particular incident that stood out the most I watched an elderly couple come to the window. as the wife tried to assist her husband with the visit. The clerks tone was so loud as she was disrespectful. She stopped the wife from speaking. As she stated we don’t need two,customers at the window! It sent me to Jesus to pray if these people have problems at home and can not deal with people please escort them to employment that their attitudes would serve its purpose. Not only being disrespected but long unnecessary wait time and the lengthy list continues. This is my experience not everyone has the same . But I pray yours will better than mine !",1

"THEY PROMISED and THEY DELIVERED!! I was in and out in less than 10 minutes. The staff are really great communicators, and my duplicate title was ready for p/u in 48 hours! There's plenty of parking directly in front so parking is a breeze. Drive to this location even if it's a few miles out of your way. You'll be happy you did.",5
They prioritize people who can complete services online. They emphasize appointments but are a month out. I have seen people here for over 3 hours on a fast day. If i could figure out which elected official to bug I would.,1
They post that they are open until 5 however we showed up at 4 and were not allowed in.  The excuse was they were at capacity.  I looked in and there were a...,1
They people were so nice. I'm not the best with figuring out the scan QR code but they helped me. The gentleman at my window was so friendly. He was at #16 @9:45am. Super nice and made the whole process easy.  I love the appointment based approach! It does not make it so overwhelming and crowded. Overall great experiance!,5
"They pass a test. They were friendly and respect our Constitution in the video. A journalist goes around to check if government will do their jobs or not. Also, he sees if they respect our Country and our Constitution. Great to see they pass.",4
"They open at 8:00AM on Saturdays, arrived at 7:30AM and checked in via text message. At 7:50AM got a text back with instructions and a ticket number. At 8:02AM received the text message telling me to go to the door to wait to be called. AT 8:05AM I was called in, took about 20 minutes to get everything done and I was done, the clerk was polite and helpful. Overall little less than one hour total from the time I arrived. When I was leaving there was considerable more people outside on the lot so I recommend getting there early if able and follow instructions, specially the check in part.",5
"They only hired people who have association with current employees. No doubt the road design and all other things look nothing but messy and trashy. And the most ""amazing"" thing is that MassDOT have lots of tolls on roads with inferior facilities. You cannot see anything while driving at night. MassDOT discriminate and ignore Asian males students.",1
They only do appointments no walk-ins but they never answer the phone to make an appointment.,1
They only attend you by appointment. Good and safe place.,5
They never pick up the phone but are fast to charge your credit card beware!,1
"They NEVER open up on time.  I’d prefer the website shows them as “Opens at 7:30” so I’m not disappointed every single time I go.  They literally stroll in late EVERY DAY.    Nonchalantly, like they don’t care...... Oh wait I keep forgetting, THEY DONT CARE!  You guys need to list accurate opening and closing times!  You guys need to update your website DAILY.  Because right now online you’re showing open but I’ve been standing outside in the heat for over an hour now and this is not the first time.",1
They never let me down. trustworthy and reliable. Honest and excellent service. My favorite mechanics since 2005,5
They never have the phones on or answer the phones. Knowing peoples lives can be messed up if they miss court. This kinda stuff just pisses me off. I’ve been trying to call them for 15 minutes now.,1

They never answer the phone 🙄,5
"They never answer no matter what time of day even with only 2 or 3 people in que. They leave you hoping all day someone may eventually answer, but to no avail. Is nobody working here? Or is it just 1 person who only feels like picking up sometimes? Never had much success reaching them. Something needs to change",1
"They need to understand historical trends in volume to staff correctly.  I came in mid-month on a weekday at 10am, waited 30 mins, found out I was missing...",2
They need to find someone that answers the phones in more polite manner. All I asked is if they were open this Friday being good Friday and she snapped at me like what do you want? What are you doing? I was caught off guard like uhhhh. I was at a loss for words like jeez. Someone must have missed lunch!,1
They need to change there hours online! Just drove super far to get there at 5:45 and they close at 5:30pm. On there website it says 6:00pm. Thanks a lot for wasting my time jerks,1
They need a better system here. Nobody is using their brain in Illinois during this pandemic. People who work should not have to wait 4-6 hours for the retired elderly who can wait. They need to make a special day/time for them instead of cut in line everyday any moment.,1
"They moved to the police precinct as of this post (early 2021). So do not go to Walmart.

Also the service was amazing. Was super fast and everyone was super friendly. Only place I'm going now",5

"They make it seem like they're not doing walk-ins because of covid. This is not true. They are. I repeat, THEY ARE DOING WALK-INS. I made an appointment when i really didn't need to because online they make it seem like you need to. I pay taxes, I should be able to go to a location and register my vehicle without jumping through unnecessary hoops like scheduling an appointment online. This review was posted 5/18/21.",1
"They made the process easiest and fastest . Never have I ever thought I could be done with car and license within 2 hours with an expired and out of state case… they know what they are doing and make customers life easy.

"They have huge scope of improvement. To be nice is not all that is required in a place like this. I truely believe efficiency is lacking. I don't wanna sound harsh but if you have to come 4/5 times to solve something and wait hours just because the person deals with it, is in a meeting, Its time you check what is needed to provide a better service.",3

They have a system and it works. Pleasant attitude. Grateful for their location.,5
"They have a new feature ""Get in line"" go online to the Ohio DMV website to hold your place. DO IT ONLINE! When you go inside to check in the people can sometimes be rude. Depending on who checks you in (the older gentleman with salt and pepper hair) they will tell you they have no idea on your wait time. The website will give you an accurate estimate and assign your number. You will then receive a text as to when you should begin listening for your number. You go in and that's that! MAKE SURE YOU ARE THERE TO HEAR YOUR NUMBER. IF YOU MISS YOUR TURN YOU HAVE TO START OVER IN LINE!  The wait in line feature receives 5⭐ The fact that one employee was sending people to the self service kiosk while another was yelling it's out of order lowers their score. It would take thirty seconds to make an OUT OF ORDER sign. Also the gentleman up front is pretty selective as to whom he showed kindness. Just my opinion based on an hour of observation.",3
They have a good system where you fill out the information online and make an appointment before going. I had to get a new TN licence and a new resident from FL. Agents were friendly and professional.,5
"THEY HAVE A $23 CONVENIENCE FEE! I feel jipped! I should've read the sign.  The state fee for a duplicate Driver's License is $17.  Plus their $23 ""convenience fee"", I paid $40!! Ridiculous.

Then after approaching me they ask me to go outside because I didn't want to sit and 3 of the benches that were empty when I arrived had been filled by people who came in AFTER me.",1
They don’t treat you like a person. They treat you like cattle. And to get a real ID all you need is a drivers license. What’s the point??,1

They are not in customer service. They are friendly enough considering what and whom they deal with on a regular basis. Not their fault when someone brings in the wrong documents. Those who rate poorly based on not getting the Disney treatment need to reassess their expectations.,4
They are nice people. If you come here for anything but CDL related things expect to sit 3 to 5 hours. You wait in your car for groups of 10 to 15 to be called in. Arriving at 630 or 7 will get you in sooner but it will still take hours to process you.,3
they are nice and  quick they only ask for  documents for resigns and that is the proper process.,5

Again, no one wants to work so they are short handed, don't get mad at them if it takes a little extra time. Be courteous and all will go smooth.",5

TIP I couldn't get an appointment for 6 months or more(probably like all of you). They open at 8 here. Get there at 7 and get in the front of the line. Average inspection time I saw while I waited was 20 minutes and appointments go ahead of non appointments.,4

Disabled veterns are not supposed to be charged a licensing fee. They are charging disabled vets fees, and they're issuing regular plates instead of the disabled vets plates.

Just go to the state department of licensing or motor vehicles.",1
"These people have no clue what customer service is! I walked in 5 Minutes till’ closing and I have all the paperwork in order, just needed to file for tax and get receipt to be able to renew business license. In the waiting room there were three more people filling out paper work and I approached the worker at the counter. She said come back tomorrow we’re about to walk out the door. I told her I’d driven a good ways from there and she said we about to leave. I asked her why the door was still open and why couldn’t she serve me since the doors are still open and it wasn’t 4:30pm yet. Usually you take anyone that walks in before posted closing time and then process them and then you leave. I’m glad President Trump has passed law where these types of people can easily be fired for low performance and incompetence. I’ve noticed government employees have become complacent and lack customer care. It’s time to replace these people with other hardworking people. Plus who closes offices at 4:25pm? It used to be 8am -5pm!  Too bad I still need to return a different day for this bs.",1
These people could care less about helping you. When you walk in the door you're instantly treated like you're already a problem to them and all they want to do is find a way to get rid of you so they don't have to do their job..

Apparently they don't know how to process DUIs, they send you out a letter to where no matter how hard you try, you can't get everything worked out in time, so that you lose your license, I bet it was their own children they would do things a little bit more speedier or at least with common sense in mind. If people treated people the way that they should, this world would be a lot better place",1
"These people are not friendly. My husband gave them his driver's license to copy and never gave it back and of course they did not have any idea of where it could be!

"These folks are bureaucrats that really don't care about individuals concerns.  I'm sorry to say that... but helping the people of NYS is their job not helping the bureaucracy.  A little kindness, understanding and paying it forward would go along way.  If you know the answer of how to help a situation, offer that up, don't just pass the buck as a bureaucrat.  Dealing with people daily is their job and helping people if you're not a people person it's not a job for you.  The DMV isn't social work but you are doing a service for the public...

I suppose I could justify if there was some kind of a rush to get people in and out, but there were me and one other person being served with several people not busy. People go to the OMV when they need help generally and yet I always get rude and sassy service. I expect more.",1

"There have been very few times I have visited the Shelby County Clerk's office and was treated like a human. The women who work in the office have the worst attitudes EVER.

I would like to say I understand they deal with a plethora of personalities and a daily basis. And, they knew what they were signing up for when the accepted the job. But, that is not the case.

Some of these women have attitudes when they begin dealing with their first customer of the day. They have zero customer service skills. ZERO. And, they are allowed to dress like they are on their way fry fish; rather than dress like they are representing a government entity.

The ladies at the Germantown location were always more than helpful and greeted everyone with a smile. They did not yell, roll their eyes or neck and definitely did not pop their mouth or eat when dealing with customers. And, they definitely did not yell across the room to one another as they carried one a full conversation as if the customer was not there. REOPEN THE GERMANTOWN OFFICE.

My only other pleasant experience is when dealing with one lady who works at the downtown location. She has the most welcoming attitude each and every time I have gone into that office. I don't know her name, but she has a light skin complexion, wears glasses and sit on the north side of the office in the cubicle closest to the door. The rest of the staff members at the clerks' office (Downtown, Mullins Station and Poplar Plaza) should attend mandatory training in social etiquette and dealing with the public.

I feel a little better now that I written a review. Not that my review will do anything to address or change how customers are treated in the clerk's office; especially when this behavior has been going on for years.",1

You need to fill out a section, have the lien holder complete a section and have that notarized, have the new state DMV complete a section and return all of that to the Kansas Dept of Rev. That's all just to get the title released. From there you're back to the basics of transferring a title.

When it was my turn I had the pleasure of working with Ashlee. I had 2 titles, with probate documentation and a death certificate, that needed put into my name, one of which needed tags, and 2 motorcycle renewals. Ashlee was not only on top of her game, she also asked questions to make sure I was getting exactly what I needed that I didn't think or know to ask for, doing so in a professional manner and still  friendly and compassionate in handling everything I needed. She knew exactly what she was doing, keeping focus yet still maintaining one on one rapport with her customer, who was her only agenda while I was in front of her. Where I work we call that kind of service ""Moments of Magic"" and Ashlee certainly delivered 110%!  Thank you Ashlee!",5

The young lady that I spoke to was amazing... I've had some decent experiences but she definitely had God's Gift of customer service. Although they could not help me right now and time waiting on the dealership to register my vehicle they were at least very cordial about it and even offered me a chance to come in immediately to pick up what I needed when I come back.,4
The young ladies at this office deserve a standing ovation!!! Although they are not open for full service they are open.  I can’t believe that people were getting mad because the have limited services due to the caution surrounding the virus.  I just moved from South Carolina and was able to switch my tag.  That wasn’t the best part.  They were extremely positive and kept the air lighter even when all this was going on!!! Kudos ladies!!! Kudos!,5

"The worst DMV. Extremely unorganized, employees don’t have accurate answers. The “manager” Piper will literally raise her voice when you ask her a question and will simply REPEAT herself time after time with no change in her answer. When I asked her to look up my personal property online she actually rolled her eyes at me. HORRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE.

The wait was over 2 hours to title a vehicle when the ticket employee state “about an hour” upon arrival to the congested unorganized “line” to get a ticket number like a deli counter. They should have a text system with an online sign up but I guess that technology doesn’t exist in Independence.

Now let’s talk about how less than 50% of people were wearing masks. There was NO social distancing inside the building, most seats were taken(the seats are actually zip-tied together so they can’t be moved or spaced apart) and elderly were having to stand. I choose to wait outside due to the PANDEMIC (they must not have heard of that yet). They have the live ticket numbers posted outside, however people were blocking them (if they didn’t put them a foot off the sidewalk they may be more visible to everyone inside and out).

This is crazy to me that they think this is acceptable for a service every driving person in Johnson County needs. Besides that, the employees I worked with were very kind and worked quickly. So i do not hold this against employees at all. Hopefully someone sees all the feedback on the virtual queue and gets rid of it.",3

The test center is located in what appears to be an abandoned building. The entrance is in the back on the lower( under ground ) parking lot. There were vagrants huddled by the door.

"The staff was a 5/5 stars BUT the convenience  fee cost as much as my license renewal. $30 license renewal with a $23 convenience charge (which was NOT mentioned before…or on the website anywhere…). I’ve been to places before that the convenience fee was $5 (which I didn’t mind since they were great).  plus something good to know is- they don’t accept card. Only accepts cash. Which honestly I didn’t mind since they had an ATM on-site, but in what way was paying $4 atm fee plus $23 convenience fee actually fair??
If you want nice people, then go here for sure. They are so nice. But if you can make it to the walker site, then I’d go there and save the inconvenience of unknown fees.",2

"The staff is friendly and courteous, and it is not their fault, but the government decided hours of operation make it nearly impossible for anybody who works to get anything done.  Both this place and the local title office are only open for 4 hours on Saturday which means that transferring a title and then putting plates on the vehicle in one day is not possible with the given wait times.

The government wants me to work, but will not provide government services at a time where the working man can access them.  Would be far better to be closed on a random day during the week, and then open for a full 8-hour work day on Saturday.

I am now forced to drive an unplated truck for 4 days this week until I can give up half of my Saturday to wait in line here again.  Wonderful.  I'm only awarding one star because zero is not possible.",1

The staff here at sooner tag agency are the best in the business. My wallet got stolen and in it was my government issued ID. I worked with Laurie to get my ID replaced. She went above and beyond to see to it that my ID number was changed in case whoever stole my old ID tried doing something illegal with it. She was so kind and compassionate. Anyone would be blessed to have Laurie as their employee. We even came back later that day to bring them donuts for all of their hard work for me. I could have cried knowing that there are still good people on this earth. Job well done Lori! My family has found their new tag agency. Thank you again for the amazing service.,5
"The staff has always been helpful to me.  On one occasion, I threw them a real curve-ball with a vehicle registration which they were (rightfully) incapable of granting because of a documentation issue on my end.  They called me at home later that afternoon to discuss more options for me.  They went above & beyond in that instance.",5
"The staff has always been great at the Rochester office.  Got greeted from the moment that I walked in and the tech took my pet right away. When the tech came back with my pet, it started to get a bit loud in there with pets and I asked if I could take my pet out to my car and would come right back to pay and the tech let me. It's great going to a vet that cares about the pets and understands pets needs.  HIGHLY RECOMMENDED",5

I walked in and waited for a while at the front with no staff member there while they spoke about what tv show they were watching, eyelashes, and also spoke about a customers personal business  loudly. After finally being told where to proceed, while waiting they discussed what show they were watching again and what happened on the episode and etc, they were very loud while helping or I think helping one customer.

First my Husband ask which window to go to cause our number was just called and she looks at him all funny and walks away.. then comes back.. and proceeds to get nasty with me about the title not being completed. The seller had already filled out his part and wasn't with me so I waited until I got in front of the worker to sign my part since I messed one up before by filling it out in the wrong spots before, she had the worse attitude.  She turned up her nose at me, looked at the title and got smart with me and said it's not completely filled out so when I told her why I didn't complete it she pointed to the line and said fill out that part. Also while we were there another young lady comes in and they ask what her number was, they tell her we called your number 3 times and if you don't respond we cancel and you have to come back, in most cases I understand if they're busy but there was no one else waiting and she said she signed in online and said her number had just gotten called, instead 2 more people got smart with her and told her to come back Monday and when she left they started making jokes about her not following directions and as a result having to come back.   I will never go back there again.  Too much unnecessary attitude for me.",1

The service is outstanding. However these security guards are out of control. As I was headed to the door with mask in hand and on the phone I was startled by loud bangs on the glass. I looked up and the woman was making gestures to put my mask on. I was 10 feet from the door. The ones inside were just as bossy. I am almost 60 years old and a business owner . I treat everyone with respect but it was to do the same with all the guards inside. I could easily see how people could be intimidated. I could also see how someone could slap them too.,4

"The roofing was great, and I'll keep my comments below. But there turned out to be some damage done to my HVAC system while they were installing the roof (a clear roofing nail in the Freon). I asked for Castro Roofing to submit it to their insurance for review. They've largely ignored me and my requests. I'm quite disappointed, because I had liked the company and people that worked there.

Castro Roofing was professional and accommodating. They took the time to explain options and benefits of different solutions. They didn't nickel and dime me and instead provided details so I could make informed decisions. The roof looks great. The team was considerate and quick, with an attention to quality that was apparent in the types of questions they asked me about the installation.",1
The roads on the interstate 80 are TERRIBLE. I’m moving across country and had to drive through towing a trailer. We thought we were going to pop a tire. There’s a million and one pot holes and they aren’t small. Someone should fix this ASAP! It’s very dangerous. My friend died in this interstate in January. This needs to be fixed.

We were seen promptly at our given appointment time, the staff was courteous and helpful in the waiting area and the room was maintained at a comfortable temperature. The best part however was Charlotte Acton at desk 36. She skillfully navigated us through a rather difficult series of hoops we had to jump through in order to secure the ID and had the utmost patience with us as we scrambled to assemble the necessary documents. She was a professional through and through and made us feel extremely valued and cared for, a rarity when dealing with government entities!",5

We reached out and received instant and comprehensive instructions as to the next step and what else was required.  She worked with us the entire way. Even when we made a mistake, she was able to quickly determine the new course of action we needed to take and guided us in that direction.  Overall, this was a completely painless process and I would highly recommend using this team.",5

I surrendered my Dad’s car tags and registration after he passed. The attendant didn’t provide any guidance, she just took both license plate and registration and said thank you. When I asked how to get a refund she said I needed a paper from Probate. She didn’t know the name of the paper, didn’t ask someone for help, just the paper from probate. I returned with all the papers from Probate but not the one she needed, still no guidance on the exact paper I needed. When I returned with Certificate of Appointment paper from Probate I was able to receive a receipt. No next steps were provided, I had to ask how a refund was completed, downtown or with the county? She knew I needed to go downtown but didn’t know what papers I needed or process of receiving refund for the deceased. DMV, please provide empathy training and a list of steps for Personal Representatives to surrender tag, registration and refund. I think this would be most helpful for the staff to provide a document to the person that guides through the process. Thanks.",3
"The other reviews don't lie, Joyce is amazing as she sounds. Seriously, stop looking for other driving test locations - this is the one you want.

I booked a quick review lesson followed immediately by a driving test. In total, I spent two hours behind the wheel next to Joyce, who, although was a complete stranger, made me feel perfectly comfortable the whole entire time. She shared her vast knowledge of Washington driving laws and nuances, taught me new tips and tricks for mastering some trickier maneuvers, and then proceeded to professionally and fairly evaluate my driving during the test.

We've all heard the horror stories about awful driving instructors and driving test evaluators. Joyce is the complete opposite, to the point where she decided to give me a second chance on my test when a weird encounter with another driver ruined my ability to pass. She saved me weeks of time in doing so, and I'm very grateful for it.

PS. When paying her after your lesson/test, be sure to tip her. The application she uses to process payments doesn't make it clear that this is an option, and a glare on the screen caused me to miss it entirely. She deserves the tip!",5

"The MVD is never pleasant, but I will never return to this particular MVD Express. Horrible customer service from the moment I walked in. I went in needing a personal document notarized and help with the document itself, and instead of being informative and assistive, the young woman assisting me passed on the document to many of her coworkers as they giggled and made it obvious they didn’t know how to proceed with it. Which is fine, no worries. There’s ways to communicate and ask for help from coworkers/ the MVD Help line without giggling about a customer’s personal document right in front of them and other customers, and passing around personal information for different people to see. Also, leaving documents in plain sight for other customers to see while they giggle and crack jokes. Extremely unprofessional. I drove straight to an MVD Now and was assisted right away, with amazing customer service and left with that same document notarized. People in the area know not to go to this location for this same horrible customer service but I figured I’d give them a shot, how bad could it be? Nope. Never again. Don’t waste your time and money, and save yourself the embarrassment LOL.",1

"The most organized, friendliest license bureau I've ever been to.  They have someone who greets you at the door who'll make sure you're in the right place so you don't stand around and wait only to find out they can't help you.  This keeps the line short (a lot of people show up only to find out they need to go to a title bureau or somewhere else first) and it also makes for a more pleasant atmosphere as people aren't waiting 20 minutes for nothing.",5

"The most inept municipality in the Greater Kansas City area, bar none!  I'm a former resident now residing in a neighboring county but my adult children continue to live in my house there.  My son purchased a used car so we went on line to ascertain the current registration process.  Nowhere on the website is it mentioned that you must have a scheduled appointment in order to complete this type of transaction.  My son had taken the morning off to complete this task.  His missed time and was inconvenienced.  This could've been prevented with a simple website update but apparently citizen inconvenience remains a non-issue for this city.  When we arrived a kind officer informed us that we were not allowed into the courthouse unless we had an appointment and pointed out to  us a posted notice that included this new rule and a weblink to schedule an appointment.  Here's the best part, appointments were booked out to June 17th, a full 22 days from today.  We went back to the website to see if there was any information regarding what steps we could take ameliorate this while we waited for an upcoming appointment.  There was nothing listed so we called and remained on hold for 45 minutes before we encountered a system error that informed us that our call was ending.  So we filled out an application to drop the title work off, hit submit, the application closed  with no way to print and as yet no subsequent confirmation email.  It bears repeating how inept this place is.",1

The most helpless tag agency in town and a great reflection of the attitude of this side of town overall. Every time I go here to transfer titles there’s always some reason or another as to why they can’t. I have out of state insurance and it’s never given me an issue titling multiple cars over the last few years but of course I “can’t” title my car due to this at this agency.

The modifications they've made for the pandemic have made going to the DPS a much less painful process. Everyone is now required to have an appointment and this streamlined the ease.

I call 2 weeks later to find out my request was denied and no one was going to let me know about it. Meanwhile I'm now driving with expired tags. Then I overnight shipped the additional documents they asked for. 2 weeks later, they still haven't approved my registration! It's September 10th...

"The kiosk here particularly works great! And it is a lifesaver by far! Especially in the times we are in right now. If you need to go inside this DMV then it's going to be hard. They are not accepting walk-ins right now. You have to call or set up an appointment online prior to going in. And then you have to wait outside for your number to be called as they are only allowing a few people in at a time. Luckily I just needed to renew my registration. They have 2 outside kiosks. And, unlike most of the kiosks, they accept cash. Most others only accept credit or debit cards. It was an easy process. I was done within 5 minutes. I would highly recommend using the kiosk if you can. It's a lot easier.",5

I called and was placed on hold for 20 minutes, they arent the most friendly people to deal with in the morning and they treat you like your not a human being.",2
The instructor was a male and he had a very bad attitude. When giving the test he told me to turn but then tells me to parallel park and when I went to parallel park he says no so rudely and tell me to parallel park somewhere else as if I was suppose to already know where he wanted me to go… I don’t not recommend this testing site and if I could give this a negative rating I would. Something needs to be done,1
"The instructor Roxanna was super patient with me during the practice road test. I had a great experience, and the prices are reasonable.  Thank you so much and for the tips. Definitely going to recommend my friends here to go.",5
"The instructor I got was nice.

I do, however, recommend for most people to go somewhere else where you test on the actual cities/suburbs. So if you're going here, honestly prepare yourself! Practice does make perfect, but don't get frustrated if you don't pass here, sometimes you just have to try an actual road test, and not a course type thing. You can find those places, here, it's kind of unrealistic, too squeezed of a course so everything is jammed pack, (I'm not sure how to explain it, but it's just a confusing place all together, it's just too much going on) and the instructor says left/right and what to do- kind of late. (Not even my GPS or anyone who tells me where to go, does that, they say it as soon as possible, it's more realistic to plan the next move right away in your head to be a safe driver. It would be nice if they tell you a step ahead at least.)

It went fast and after entering the building. They guide you to a kiosk and help you check in and give you an appointment time, which for me it was at 9:40am. When renewing your license you need to fill out an application. Make sure you have your birth certificate, SS card and picture ID( Drivers license) handy. Good thing about it your not sitting for hours 😉👍",5

One lady told her to have a good day, she ignored her until the lady repeated herself twice. So rude!! She must really hate her job. I definitely won't be back.",1
The front desk lady is extremely rude and unprofessional. I don’t understand how someone would want her to be the person that clients first meet when going to the DMV. She constantly rolls her eyes and gets frustrated easily when she cannot hear you. If she hates her job so much maybe she should quit so they can hire someone who can at least make this experience more pleasant.,1

I called ahead to let them know I was going to be cutting it close to their closing time. The lady on the phone was very informative on their closing time at 4pm. When I got there I was greeted with the same, ""We close at 4pm"". She took care of me quick enough, but reminded everyone that came through that door that they close at 4pm. Sometimes even twice. After taking the test she said head to the treasury. Not that it was located on the second floor or go up one floor and look east when you to the hallway. I am glad to be done with renewing my driver's license and will never return there again. I advise anyone to go somewhere else. By the way, they close at 4pm.",1
The D M V was pretty good. Actually I was in and out of there in an hour. There was some people that like standing outside. And start talking and they forget what their number is so they come in complaining. They have handicap parking. But no handicap doors so you might as well not have any handicap at all people come in. But overall the experience was pretty good.,4

However, I was also under a time constraint so my options were limited and I ended up needing to schedule an appointment two hours away! I called customer service as a last resort to ask about the process of mailing in my information as I wasn’t super confident about the online information, and they were amazing. Sadly I don’t remember her name, but the woman that I spoke to was so informative and helpful and walked me through the process very patiently. It didn’t feel like she was rushing to get to the next person or annoyed by my questions. She was so willing to help and went above and beyond trying to help me. It was completely worth the wait time on hold.",5

The clerks that work in this office are terrible human beings. They discriminated against me. They gave me hard time last year when registering business vehicles and this year. For no reason. Telling me my vehicles don’t have NH plates when she had the registrations in her hand. When she realized that she was wrong she said “someone told them that my business isn’t located in NH.” I gave her a business letter head last year when they did the same thing to me. I told them whoever said that my business wasn’t located at the address on the registration lied. I presented the same letter from last year with NH address and she required that I present a lease. All 4 Clark’s agreed with each other.  I had to leave and get the lease. When I came back with the lease she said it was residential rental when in fact it wasn’t. She eventually registered the vehicles even though she did her best to prevent me to do business in NH. I’m sure they wouldn’t give me hard time if I looked like them. Everyone else was coming and going within minutes except me.,1
"The clerks are very efficient, yet no nonsense, polite bantering seems to be discouraged; I would attribute that to the high volume of people coming in and out.

I was in and out within 10-12 minutes,  which must be a personal record best.

If anyone intends to just have a license or regular i.d. made I would recommend this location over all the others in Louisville however, if you're purpose is to have  the newly designated (REAL ID) made, they do require that you schedual an appointment online via the Kentucky Transportation Cabinet @ (ReaLIDKy.com)

People, look up Texas DPS Drivers License and you will see this place is NOT recommended to come too.  There is plenty of information online to say Do NOT come here.

"Terribly unorganized even with a check-in process. Make sure if you decide to go that you check in AND make sure your number is still active otherwise they'll never get to you! Had to step out of line to ask what the deal was and received an accused look of 'are you sure'. Yep...look at your text and I'm holding the clipboard you handed me when you marked me present! At least Precious was kind and the gentleman that did the license was polite and cheerful otherwise, never again!!",1

"Terrible! Cheryl, I'm guessing the ""supervisor"" or whatever is not a good person. I went waited 45min only to find out I did not have a proper ""bill of sale"" (or so I was told) So I wasn't mad, it was on me, for not having the correct paperwork, so I was directed to Cheryl, who told me what I needed and I said I would be back. I then contacted who I needed to and received another bill of sale saying exactly what I was told I needed so I went back a few hours later. I waited in the first line for 10min and asked if I would have to wait as long as I did earlier in the day. The nice lady said no, just wait by the window you were at earlier and they can take you next. I went over to the window and patiently waited. I was called over when she was done with the previous person and said I brought everything you asked. She snatched the papers out of my hand and asked where I got it. I told her it was faxed to my shop and I brought it right here. She then told me I needed to have the company I bought the car from fax the bill of sale directly to her. I asked the simple question of ""why is this not sufficient?"" and immediately she began to yell at me and tell me that I was not cooperating. It got to the point where the people next to me and the employees, were staring wondering what was going on. I grabbed my papers back and walked out.
I went to the DMV off of loomis the following day with all the same pieces of paper and the lady there was super polite and didn't even need the ""bill of sale"" and said the other two pieces of paper were all she needed. I told her what happened and she couldn't believe what happened.
I will never be back to this DMV again and I hope Cheryl finds Jesus or someone, because there is no reason for treating people this way!",1

"Terrible service and staff. Kathy the front door greeter is rude and impolite, should not be working with people. Spoke with Terry (said she was in charge and the lady to talk to), she was super rude and not helpful. Waited in line for 2 hours this morning only for my minor child to do one question to get his permit and then they turned him away. I don’t know how you can be turning people away when your building office hours do not reflect this…. Said they are having computer problems and it’s taking people 20 minutes to test. I could care less how long it takes, we waited 2 HOURS, what would another 20 minutes do.  Super frustrating we got to watch other children test and get to take their driving portions. Not to mention they take minors into their building without parents/guardians. I have never experienced such terrible service at any other DMV in the state and I shared my experiences with Terry, only to be told in a snarky tone “well head over and see the girls in Rock Springs”. Management and staff need to be reevaluated.",1

Terrible I have gone to this location 2 times and tried to process my registration a total of 6 times and was not able to complete for some reasons I guess the kiosk  Would not accept my Bank of America debit card nor my credit card I tried 2 different days wasting my time.,1
Terrible experience. Took my twin daughters here for their permit test & one of my daughters had a terrible experience with one of the employees here. My daughter was nervous & had never been inside a DMV before. The lady ( which is hard to call this woman) was extremely snippy with her & made her feel very insecure before taking her permit test. I won’t go into specifics but I got the sense that this lady was on a major power trip. I went to this DMV back in the mid 90’s to get my permit & license & thought how awesome it would be to bring my 15 year old daughters back here to do the same. Big mistake....,1
"Terrible experience. I do not recommend going here at all. The staff were rude, the printing kiosk did not work and even the registration machine made mistakes (my number was called for me to go to a counter and when I did the employee working there aggressively told me to leave because he didn’t have my number). Also, if you are a Muslim woman that wears the headscarf, the employees will insist for you to show your hairline. When I explained how I have not had to in the past and felt uncomfortable by the request, I had to call for the supervisor. It’s a baseless and unnecessary request. I’d also recommend some diversity training to the staff.",1

Just for their supervisor to tell me that she does not read Spanish so I need to translate another document and she will not release the form from the the police inspection! So much for being a professional. None of the staff there is trained to handle these types of documents and neither is she.unbelievable how a person is treated I spent 3 trips and 2 hours on each visit! And still left with no form to register it!",1

Tara was fantastic to work with. We moved out of state from Arizona to here and it has not been easy to get an ID card for my husband.

Definitely got better service here then the DMV that we were sent to in Mansfield who treated us like garbage. We will definitely use this place in the future.,5
Tamy was the most awesome and helpful lady. She took an extra mile to make all of our paperwork for cars work. She basically got three(not two) stones in one one shot done. Love those people who take an extra mile.,5
"Talk about unprofessionalism, they have their phones set up where they always stay busy and never answer because they can’t retain any staff members and have a high turnover rate for employment because they under pay all of their employees.

Move to another state before you try and register your boat in MA/ at the Springfield office. 1 star is too good of a review.",1

"Sure, it sucks that I had an appointment for 6 months but, from start to finish, it only took 20-30 minutes to get in and get out. Make sure you have all of the documents that's needed. Hard (paper) copies, not digital copies or pictures. Be smart about that. If you have to bring extra forms of identification and everything needs to be current and not expired. People complaining about documents or appointments means they didn't follow what was on the website. We're in a new time. Accept that things aren't going to be as easy as they were before and stop trying to take shortcuts. Esoterically for Federal documentation.

"Super sweet lady working the counter was as pleasant as she could be when she estimated a one hour wait for a permit test.  Your wait number has a letter code in front and they show you how many are waiting for what type of service.  70 minutes later, ONE walk-in test taker had been called and there were nine others in front of us.  Only three test-takers with appointments had been called back.  They administered four knowledge tests in 70 minutes.  First of all, that is inexcusable for a county our size.  Secondly, anyone could have accurately estimated it would take until the end of the work day before we were called back when we walked in at 9 a.m. There is no need to rob the tax payers of their time that way.  Just be honest.",1

"Super organized!  I went in July 2021 for an expired car registration and was in and out in 45 minutes.  You check in outside with your name and phone number so they can text you when you are about to be called.  It's like waiting in a virtual line.  Then you can either wait in your car or go inside to their waiting area and sit down.  They give you a paper ticket you will show to get in, so keep it with you.  There's a large screen displaying ticket numbers and which station to go to.  They also call numbers on a PA system.  People were friendly and helpful.  Yes, there are public bathrooms and plenty of seats to wait in and spread out.  There are lots of people, so I suggest a mask.  They're recommended, but not required as of July 14, 2021.

"Super effecient and friendly employees! I got there an hour before they opened on a Thursday morning, but by the time they opened (at 9 am) there were only about 15 other people. It took less than 10 minutes to get a license renewal. A nice young gentleman helped me and was super kind! The line over a man had an issue with the documents he had brought and the young woman looked up his info for him to help out. Great service, thank you!",5

"Such a poor experience.  Start to finish it took 30 minutes.  Doesn’t sound too bad.  It should have taken 4 minutes.  Not sure why NO ONE was working on Monday morning.  There are 3 windows for tag renewal and only 1 person working? The place was pretty full and people aren’t required to wear masks or distance themselves!?! There were 2 people ahead of me and I waited 30 min. I had my stop watch going, just to see how long it was going to take. Adding the break the only guy took before assisting me and 2 other people renewing it took him 25 minutes. When I made it to the counter it took exactly 4 minutes and 26 seconds start to finish. So WHY are they so slow?  All I can assume is POOR MANAGEMENT .  They could do so much better.",2

The lady just kept sending me away to try to figure out what information I needed on my own and seemed so annoyed anytime I asked for clarity. I’m sure it seems obvious to her because she deals with titles every day, but, at least for me who doesn’t think about this every day, a little support & patience would go a long way.

"Staff seemed overworked, and wait time was a little long, but they still had great attitudes and were a pleasure to work with. Would suggest keeping at least an hour free following your appointment time.  The staff seemed to handle problems confidently and pleasantly.  They have Covid measures in place and masks are encouraged, but not required if fully vaccinated.
MAKE AN APPOINTMENT!!   Can't stress this enough.  For scheduling and faster service it helps everyone and gets you in the door (and out) much faster.  As most licensing offices they take debit / credit but there is a $2+ charge so suggest cash or check to avoid this fee. As far as walk ins go they are taken around appointments, so again suggest scheduling an appointment.  Driver and CDL testing plus Enhanced ID / License applications and possible other services stop an hour before the office closes.

Schedule appointment whenever possible :-)",4

"Staff is overwhelmed as expected but relatively the service is good, more so in the time of COVID 19, obviously more staff is added, making it much easier for customers to navigate where they should be and what they should be doing. I'll advise all those taking a permit test to do it online, it's a bit difficult because of the 50 questions, you have no time to review any material, so all questions must be answered without cheating but it's the easiest way, even if you end up trying multiple times. To pass the test you need 40/50 correct answers, separate from road signs. Please don't attempt to cheat, the system will log you out.",3
"Staff is not professional. Too much talking and laughing by the staff when trying to take the written test.
Seems like the staff will automatically charge you an Enhanced Photo ID without asking if that's what you'd like/need which is $30 more! It was some fat black lady.

Don't think that just because your license is about to expire that they will get you taken care of even if there are 3 of them not doing anything but talking. Dont even bother going here.

So wanted to share some information about this location. Then hours listed on the website and on the message system states this location is open until 7. I arrive only to find the hours have changed and they closed at 5:30 per a paper sign on the door. When trying to speak with a manager they proceeded to say very rudely they close at 5:30 that took effect on Tues. She then proceeded to say it was because the state dictated this. When you go to this location they also have a help wanted sign. There was no apology given and nothing  said on how they would resolve the issue with the website and the phone system hours. Just told to come back tomorrow. Interestingly other locations are open til 6. Thinking the limited hrs are more related to the reduction in staff and not the state. It would be nice if the state of Missouri would make all locations the same.  Not private companies subject to share holders but instead for the people they are suppose to serve.,1
So wanted to share some information about this location. Then hours listed on the website and on the message system states this location is open until 7. I arrive only to find the hours have changed and they closed at 5:30 per a paper sign on the door. When trying to speak with a manager they proceeded to say very rudely they close at 5:30 that took effect on Tues. She then proceeded to say it was because the state dictated this. When you go to this location they also have a help wanted sign. There was no apology given and nothing  said on how they would resolve the issue with the website and the phone system hours. Just told to come back tomorrow. Interestingly other locations are open til 6. Thinking the limited hrs are more related to the reduction in staff and not the state. It would be nice if the state of Missouri would make all locations the same.  Not private companies subject to share holders but instead for the people they are suppose to serve.,1

"So I'm fully aware that no one likes the DMV, but today's experience was probably the worst I've had. I went to register a new car that I bought out of state, and the supervisor there (wish I got her name) was basically awful. She was super mean and took pleasure in telling me I didn't have the right paperwork, told me exactly what to do, which I then did and came back. Then she told me completely different information the second time and told me she never told me any of the things she did. Mind you, this was like 4 hours later so it's not like policies changed. She literally walked over to another agent because she recognized me to go over everything personally. I've never seen such a miserable person take such pleasure in being mean.",1

I was there to renew my driver's license and the lady who worked with me was very pleasant. She asked if I had Maine Veteran License Plates and was trying her best to help me get them. I did tell her it is something I plan to do.
My Service Representative was polite, through and efficient. If you got to go this location isn't God awful slow.",5
So helpful. They really try their hardest to assist people with disabilities.,5
So helpful. Great service. Applied for an identification card and was in and out in 20 minutes.,5
So helpful and friendly.  I have been there several times and great experiences each time!,5
So happy I went on a friend’s suggestion and had my son take the in car lessons with Transportation Solutions. It really took the stress off me to make sure he had all the knowledge and skills as a new driver.They prepared him for the test and he passed with flying colors. All the instructors were very friendly and followed up with me after his lessons to let me know if he needed to work on something and what they went over. We will definitely be repeating with Transportation Solutions with the next kids to come of age.,5
So grateful to this amazing staff for their friendliness and willingness to help me. I moved to Texas from China and before that Florida. All I can say is that the staff worked diligently me to make sure I had all the paperwork needed to process my Texan license application. They exemplified patience and understanding and really went above and beyond to make a stressful situation easier (on my birthday no less). I’d like to especially thank Sarah and Teretia for their understanding. My case was unique and they rose to the occasion. I believe that others helped also but I can’t remember their names. Thank you!,5

Two staffers who helped me were very helpful and informative, which made business a pleasure today.",4
"So glad I went to Mike's driving school. My experience was excellent.
The classes were very educational and a lot of fun! Mike was patient and took time to answer any questions anyone had. The 3 hour classes pass by really quickly with Mike.
He's a great in-car instructor as well. I learned more in my three classes with him than I did in the 60 hours I did on my own.
He even met me the day of my Driving Test to review with me in the car I would be using on the test, free of charge. This raised my confidence and eased my nerves.
I don't think I could have passed the test without Mike.
I would definitely recommend this driving school to everyone.",5
"So glad I ignored the negative reviews. Courteous, extremely well organized; still obsessively wiping down after each transaction even after the CDC decided it was time for a free-for-all.

"So far most of the workers have proven to be extremely unprofessional. We had to appear in court and we tried to get the date postponed on account on an injury, but no one would return our calls or answer them. We had to have a representative appear since the person that was supposed to appear was still in the hospital and mentioned it to the clerk in charge of our case, he apparently just doesn't like returning phone calls.
The next time we appeared he told us to wait outside the courtroom, left us for two hours, and then found out that he'd already left and forgotten us. I understand he's busy, but we had to put off work just to end up waiting around, that's extremely unprofessional.
Also living within the city limits is absolutely ridiculous. Chattanooga has so many nitpicky rules. I honestly wish I'd never came to this city, as soon as I can find another place to live I'm never returning.",1

It was raining so heavy and he asked to open 4 windows after we both were wet then he  start to scream at her that she was so afraid and shaking. Of course after that kind of treat she failed. I even got scared of his actions. People who works their please don’t be mean. How you know when you scream at someone maybe they pregnant and you might be cause of their  depression.
Do not recommend this place for driving test.  Stay away from them. 😔",1

Only complaint is it was kind of hot waiting in line.  Inside kind of hot.  Didn't have to wait outside. So..... not THAT bad.",4

slowest state in the country to get permits from. I've been waiting for 6 hrs so far for just width under 10 wide. They have cost me a day of work. If they were a actual business they would go out of business. This is the problem when it's government and there are no consequences for sucking at your job. Have some pride in what you do. Typical southern work ethic.,1

Set aside a good portion of your day. Be prepared to wait outside in a long line just to check in. Then you wait some more for your number to be called. They text you. Everyone is super nice and you must be patient.  But set aside a good portion of your day in order to get anything done here.

By 8:30am the line was already down the block to the corner. So, make sure you get there early if you are on a time constraint. Also, make sure you have all of the documents that you will need. You don't want to wait in line only to find out that you are missing something and have to come back another time and wait in an even longer line. My suggestion would be to call and ask or look up what you will need on their website. Overall my experience was great.",5

Sent my info in to have my name changed on my car title. ( I got married) Recieved the registration in the mail with my name misspelled. Came back to the courthouse in person. I was skipped by four people while waiting in their new Covid friendly line call. Then finally met with a clerk and she told me they cant do anything until I recieve my newly incorrect title in the mail from them. So I can take another day to go to the courthouse to get something corrected that was completely their fault. Frustration by this situation is a understatement.,1
Sent in paperwork for a new registration over 3 weeks ago. No one will ever answer the phones for “General information” however they are more than happy to take your call to make an appointment. I am honestly disgusted by the lack of communication and there use of time. I’ve sent countless emails asking for the status of my items and there has been zero responses. Absolutely ridiculous and such a waste of my time and money.,2

She couldn't find it and basically told me I was lying. The manager finally came over because I was starting to raise my voice and within 2 seconds she had found the test/exam showing he had passed.

"Resident of Illinois but purchased a car at Hertz Auto Sales in Florissant, Missouri.  Not typically a problem for car dealerships in the St. Louis Metro to deal with buyers and paperwork for Illinois residents.   Car purchased on Aug 29, 2020.  Taxes to the State of Illinois are due within 30 days of purchase.  October 28, 2020, receive a FedEx envelope from ABS with new plates and registration.  Why new plates?  No idea because we paid for a license transfer at the dealership.  November 4, 2020, I receive a Notice of Tax Due from the State of Illinois Department of Revenue because the sales taxes and registration were not received by the State of Illinois until October 23, 2020.  Calls to ABS go to voicemail and are not returned.  Why am I stuck with a penalty for poor customer service?  I paid the full price for this service already when purchasing the car.  Perhaps this company is not qualified and or does not know how to conduct business with the State of Illinois, on behalf of their paying customers?

UPDATE Dec 11. 2020.  I need to update my review of this company.  I am happy to report that ABS facilitated the resolution of the issue.  It appears that the real problem was Hertz and not ABS.  Kelsie and Sonia were both professional and responsive.  Thank You.",4

DMV in New Hampshire incapable and unwilling to help people or think outside the box. At what point are we splitting hairs and just being ridiculous? Clearly I was born in this country. I am flabbergasted at the nonsense that passes as ""policy"". Obviously they're not there to help. And this review is as  useless as the NH DMV, because they're not a business. They are not motivated to improve. They are a faceless state department that honestly doesn't care. Job security. They have it and they know it. and it shows. That's why without apology, they conduct themselves in this manner. Shameful.",1

Props to the environment in this facility! Carnae, the manager, has done a great job making sure staff is friendly and warm. Terisha was training another employee and did a great job walking her through everything all while having a nice conversation with me sitting there.

Pretty much every one I’ve been to is awful. This was just the most recent awful experience. They are so rude and inconsiderate and always have an attitude and power trip until they see how much affect it’s having on you. Then they may or may not try to be polite but they still try to exert power over you for no reason. I brought my mother in law because she needed to update her address even though she doesn’t drive or anything. The black lady behind window three was so rude until my mother in law was so stressed and she tried to act like she was ok but I can see her shaking and she’s on an oxygen machine. The lady was very presumptuous demanding things from me even though I did not have to do anything. I was trying to oblige out of politeness and then I finally told them that maybe not everyone is able to do the things so easily that you demand without even being considerate of other peoples situations. Then I asked for my DL back and she switched back to her power trip and said “you’ll get it back when I’m done with it.” And then I just told my mother I had to go back outside so then the lady tried to act polite again and said she just needed yo make a copy of it. Why she didn’t just make a copy so I could leave is just another note on how they don’t care about the people having to be processed through this useless building. Maybe try the SanMarcos location. They were actually polite.,1

I could have signed it as well, but it calls for only one signature. These ladies are not “get to yes” problem solvers for sure. They are quick to say “sorry, we can’t help you”.

I was about to get onto the main road right near the building when I was in the middle of my test and I had gotten confused because the white dashed lines are literally not there at all when they should have been. Plus everyone on the road was going way faster than the speed limit so when I did get onto the road I was confused with the lanes AND almost got rear ended by the car behind me! I understand that Tulsa might not have enough funding to paint the roads but for a drivers test I don’t think it is appropriate to have the tester assume if it’s just one larger lane (since I wasn’t familiar with the location, I assumed this) or if it is two lanes. To sum it up, I just would not test here or anywhere if you don’t know the location super well. Taking a drive around the location before your test would definelty help you and ease your nerves!",1

LOL  Contrary to advertisements and contracts, the app has no customer service.  Msla Parking employees are rude, lazy, and defiant as to citizens' rights.  Most troubling: among other shortcomings, the app randomly and ""accidentally"" charges your ccard more than what is actually showing on your receipt (check your ccard statements monthly).

"Overall my experience was pretty good. I had to create an appointment online before I came. However, when I arrived, you pretty much just got in line and you were in a standard queue, where you got a number and waited for it to be called.
It was not clear what the appointment did, although they did verify that I had one.
Staff wore masks and there were seating with good distancing.   They had a good staffing level, so I did not have to wait long.",4
Overall it was a good experience.  They keep you outside and let you in one at a time . I was able to get inside in about 15 minutes.  The young lady who was in charge was very friendly and pleasant.,4
"Overall I would give this place 4 stars. I went to get a new tag for a vehicle on a Thursday around 11:00 am. They have an outside line that didn’t take long (about 10 min with me being in the middle when I arrived to the walkway of the building) and then once you’re inside, you’re spaced out standing 6 feet apart in a line that wraps around. If you are uncomfortable with standing for prolonged time, this is a bit challenging because I had to stand about 45 min waiting as people cycled through. I was missing my husband’s drivers license once I got to the front, but the lady has a email that you can send electronic documents to, which was a lifesaver. They are not overly friendly, but I was just so happy she didn’t turn me away for missing something. It was much faster than I expected and took a little over an hour total.",4

"Our tax dollars are going to people who don't know their jobs and seem to take pleasure in having people return multiple times to get services. They seem to take pride in being ignorant and crass. Their website states they take credit cards for title transfer, but they do not tell you that you need a check or money order for tax. The front desk greeter should tell people that so that there is no useless waiting for a big bust. I will go to the currency exchange next time and pay the extra money. What a waste of time.

I found no mention of that on the website, and when I called to get more information I ended up on hold for 30 minutes listening to music interrupted every minute or so by a recorded voice telling me how important my call was to them, finally gave up and drove to the location only to be told we both had to be there, and then was told there was only one person handling all of the calls for MVD Express!!?
I tried online at the website to make an appointment but it would not show any times available for any locations or dates I selected, which may be a problem with the browser I use or something, but it was confusing and frustrating nonetheless.

"Okay. Rowan was a great clerk and did his very best to take care of us. However,  the list of required Documents for the real ID are NOT stated correctly for females who have been married! He needed my Sister's marriage license 🙄..what? She is 79 and has been the same name for a gazillion years so why would she think to bring her marriage license?  The Documents list needs to have it as a REQUIRED DOCUMENTS FOR MARRIED FEMALES: MUST Have marriage license.  Then we would know this is something we need to have now.
Otherwise we think that when we brought it to get our current license and named changed way back back when was good enough.
Please make the change on the REAL ID DOCUMENT LIST at drive.ky.gov!",3

"Okay, I know you are CERTAINLY dreading this experience you have been asked to complete as a court order or a suggestion from your lawyer.  I would HIGHLY recommend Scott's clinic to fulfill the requirement.

He absolutely makes the process as FUN as possible for students he knows don't want to be there.  I took the one-on-one class on a weekday which costs $75 over the Saturday class which is $50, but honestly, I feel I was able to pay much more attention with it being one-one-one and looking back I feel I might've lost focus if it was a larger classroom type setting.  His classes are never more than a dozen people or so but Scott and I were able to chat, get off topic frequently and otherwise shoot the breeze and help the time pass MUCH more than we would be able to in a group setting.

He is very helpful in explaining why some courses out there are not the ones you should take, and how some of them are even fake and are not accepted in court as legitimate.  You can tell he has been doing this for a long time and enjoys what he does.  He is able to teach the ENTIRE 8 hour (w/ 30 mins for lunch) without reading from papers or books.

I left his office with every intention of being a safer and more vigilant driver and his lessons have certainly stuck around with me.  You will certainly learn a few things that you did not know, and something in this course could even save your life (WEAR YOUR SEAT BELT!)

Five stars, Scott. Thanks for what you do!",5

"Oh boy, if vexing had another synonym it would be 'Kenton County Courthouse'. Arrived early to just submit one form. One form for a title request, nothing more nothing less. I will say, most of the people working there were amiable and answered my questions albeit with conflicting information. (more on that later) Get to the window and was told I didn't have all of the information filled out, then the lady pointed at a line that simply said ""add:"". That's it nothing above or below just ""	add"". Add what? Add who? They won't tell you because you're supposed to know this and the fact that you don't is just insulting! How dare I, me, the person who goes to the courthouse once a decade not fill out this obscure bureaucratic form with precision and accuracy? ""But do not fret young one, I will simply recycle you back into the queue to repent for such obscenity."" she said. (I might be paraphrasing here but the actions are the same) So indeed, I had to sit in queue once again which, one might think would mean twice the fun, sadly, this was not the case. I submitted the form and  was told I would hear back within 4-6 weeks. I go outside, call my auto fiance group and I will have a title within 5 days. Lesson learned don't have other people do what you can do yourself.

If the governing agency has a modicum of integrity, I would implore them to revisit their forms; grab one sit down and ask yourself can I fill this out completely, without error lest I be sent back to the purgatory that is the waiting queue?",2

She was very cheerful the entire time too! I'm truly grateful.",5

Not often I talk about the pleasure of going into a government office...but I did have that experience here in Sioux Falls at the Minnehaha county treasurers office. Spent a half hour with Doug working through registration of vehicles. He was patient and personable while dealing with interruptions and system slowdowns. While taking care of us he let us know about alternatives for reregistering by using kiosks that are open 24/7. Just came from a very tech rich area and they aren't doing that. From what I've seem in the few days I've been here South Dakota has it going on. They're setting the example for others to follow.,5
"Not much good to say, unfortunately.

Pros
-scheduled appointment on Friday, got one for Monday. Not bad turn around

Cons
-they simply don't pick up their phone, I called five times on three separate occasions. Their website said to call for VIN inspections instead of scheduling online, so I had to go in person to make an appointment. Had it been stated clearly online I would've done that.
-I explained my situation to a staff member (moved from a state that doesn't issue titles to older cars), they helped me make an appointment, then I was immediately turned away for not having the old title. They knew this the entire time.
-Insisted that I could just get a title from the other state in the mail, which is not true as they don't issue titles to non-residents.
-They are short staffed. Obviously this isn't the employees fault but this was their excuse when they told me to call, and I said tried many times but they do not pick up the phone.

Overall maybe it would work better if they weren't short staffed, the staff seemed unhappy and completely unwilling to help me out. I'm not trying to rail on the staff here but this was a ridiculous experience and a complete waste of time on my part.",1

Steps for successful license renewal or transfer from out of state
(1) Need social security card (can call the SS office and they can send you a temp)
(2) Arrive no later than 645 AM. Get your name on the list... at the FRONT of the list... Anything after 8AM is a 2-3 hour wait, in that case, go home, do laundry, hit the gym, come back in 2 hours while your name sits.

Its looks like a lot of employees will loses their jobs very soon because we people, who paid your salaries, we  are not trusting in your performance and will not sponsor this lack of confident kind of so call ""SERVICE""...by the way...who will paid us back our money for a service nor rendered within the terms of our service contract?",1

Not bad.  Staff was courteous. Lines were organized (with appointments). I did overhear some MVA driving instructors not being very kind to those taking their test.  Perhaps they could work on their professionalism. I was able to get everything done in 30 minutes. Spacious so we could all spread out. Apparently workers do not have to wear masks in state buildings if vaccinated.,3

Not a terrible experience. I got my VA drivers liscence and two vehicles registered in about 45 minutes. Just make sure you have everything you need and they get you in and out fairly quick. There's videos online explaining what documents you need. I saw plenty of people coming in without the right documents getting held up.,3

North Carolina should really be ashamed of themselves DMV employees. They don't know what customer services at they all act like they hate their jobs. It shows.

The people waiting in line had a sense of humor (always helpful) and it was the best experience getting my license renewed that I've ever had. Thanks and way to go!",5
Nobody likes spending their day off at the DMV but this location was actually pretty nice. They were very helpful and friendly. I just moved from out of state and had to do everything. I didn't have the correct forms and they walked me through it. There is even a station to print stuff! Since I just moved I don't have any of my things yet so that was super helpful.

I've prayed for you and I know God will bless you for what you did for me!!!🌹🌹🌹🌹♥️❤️♥️ Thank you from the bottom of my heart 💖",5

I had an appointment at 2:10, and got there around 1:40, because I'm an early bird.

We talked about the sanitizer they used, had a good laugh, and I got my stuff all before 2:10.  Highly recommend this over the one on Coliseum boulevard, even if it is out of your way, this is a good one to try!  Plus, there's a tag office in the same lot!",5

"Mycarlady went over and above any expectations that I had. I made my appointment with her last week as we needed a quick registration and tags for a new vehicle since the paper tag were about to expire on the 17th. In addition, she took care of the release of liability from a vehicle I sold. All this was done in less than 1/2 an hour. To my astonishment she called to tell me she had my registration and tags in hand the very next day. There’s a fee involved, but worth every penny not to stand in line all day at the horrid DMV. I highly recommend her service, and I personally will see her for all my DMV services in the future. She is mycarlady for sure!",5

"My wife told me to use this tag agency because they were quick and efficient, and maybe they are for her but you can't prove it by me. I first used them a few months ago to renew the tag on my vehicle and while the wait in line wasn't long at all, from the grilling I got they must have misunderstood and thought I was applying for a Top Secret security clearance. Even with that, however, it was still a better experience than I've ever had at the agency at Garnett and 21st, so I made the mistake of going back to Admiral Tag today to get a vehicle title notarized. After a 15-20 minute wait in line, I was told they couldn't notarize it because it had my full name with no suffix, while my ""Real ID"" OK driver license had the exact same full name but with the suffix, and therefore I would have to get it notarized by a notary who knows me personally--this despite the fact that said ""Real ID"" has an exceptionally good photo me that should have left no doubt in anyone's mind I was who I said I was. My wife can use them if she wants. I won't be back, unless every other tag agency in town turns out to be even worse and I absolutely have to visit one of these classic examples of our fine state's political cronyism.",1

I was under the impression that they were accepting walk-ins and not just appointments. The very helpful lady at the front referred me to someone at the desk. I was blown off and was told that my new vehicle was not titled to me, but clearly it is. They had approximately 5 no-shows for appointments, no one in line waiting to be seen and could have VERY easily assisted with my business. Very unprofessional!!",2

My visit to renew my driver's license was actually a pleasant encounter. Other than having to wait approximately 30 minutes I have zero comments. The staff at this location are all customer service focused. Really friendly and knowledgeable about their jobs. These folks are top notch all the way. I simply can't say enough good things about this license branch.,5

"My vehicle's tabs have been expired for a few years, so I called ahead (on a Saturday) to check if there was anything special I needed to bring or do to renew. The person who answered the phone looked up my plate in the system and said it would be fine, and I said I'd come right over. After half an hour drive plus waiting outside for about 20 minutes, I was told that it couldn't be done on a Saturday because they'd have to call DOL in Olympia. It would have been helpful if the person on the phone had told me that, because I was very clear I was trying to get it done that day (Saturday). Every time I go to a licensing agent other than Crossroads I am disappointed at the service level, this is yet another example of poor customer service. Getting a correct answer isn't too much to expect. Definitely won't be coming back.",1

My teen daughter just finished up with Coach Mike for her drivers license. I cannot stress enough how great of an experience he provided her and myself. I scheduled with him months out and he held up his end by contacting us to set times for pickup and make sure I had all the documentation required.

I would and will be highly recommending him to anyone who may need this type of service. Thank you Coach Mike!,5

He provided me with a summary of things they were working on, a better way to give feedback and helped me feel more confident in my son's driving.  Having already gone through normal behind the wheel this was an excellent opportunity to improve his skills  with personalized feedback. I am extremely pleased with Mr Cole and Above Average Driving School. I felt very safe in trusting Mr Cole with my son and he provided excellent instruction.

My husband and I had made an appointment to transfer our out of state licenses and registration.  We brought the required docs (per the website) and everything went smoothly and quickly.  Everyone was friendly and the woman who helped me (number 10 counter) had me laughing in stitches.  I don’t think I’ve ever laughed at a DMV/RMV before…Definitely 5 stars!,5

"My husband and I came in to turn in a license plate. Upon entering you must sign in. We were not aware that the sign in process to be seen was not done by going down the list of who came in first. So, when the lady behind me was called before myself and another gentlemen whom had also been waiting alot longer than us, the man behind the desk very rudely screamed that they were doing people with a faster process first. I totally get that however a professional response would have been more appreciated. I myself work in the Hospitality industry and no matter how busy you are a professional response means repeat business. I will not recommend Anyone coming here for services if they are busy as the man behind the desk obviously does not do well under pressure",1

She even helped my husband obtain his online PIN. We arrived 15 minutes before our scheduled appointment and needed to wait outside in line for coincidentally the same amount of time. Both of us were seen separately in 29 minutes total and left with our clear titles in hand, which was unheard of pre-Covid.",5
"My husband and I both came here to get our out-of-state driver's licenses transferred to Texas ones and overall the process was smooth and quicker than expected.

We arrived 25 minutes prior to our appointment time. Signing in using the booths right inside of the front doors, getting our ticket, and filling out the application took less than 10 minutes altogether. As soon as our appointment time came, my husband's ticket was called immediately and my ticket was called maybe a minute or two after that.

Getting all of the paperwork processed and a temporary license issued took less than 15 minutes for me. My husband was paired with someone who was a bit newer to the job, so his took somewhere closer to 25 minutes in total. Both employees were professional and pleasant.",5
"My husband and I arrived at this office about 2:30 pm., on Monday, me to get a real ID OK drivers license as we moved in from out of state, and my husband who no longer drives, to get a real ID only.  There were about six people ahead of us, but as they had several stations open we only had to wait for less than 30 minutes.   The person who waited on us was engaging and efficient, and since we had all the documentation needed, everything went smoothly and we left there with a very good impression of that office.  Thank you, Mrs. Meeker!",5

My husband and I are living full time in an RV. We came here for our residency.  It was quick and easy. Got here at 7:30 and was out before 8:00.,5
My grandson waited over two hours in line to take the driving test. There is no equitable system in place to ensure that those that are in line first will be given the test first. Management needs better coordination for the people who are administering the driving test. The people at the front counter are very professional. I just wish that the driving tests were more coordinated.,2
My grandmother went this morning to renew her license and when we got there there was a long line outside. It was mainly elderly people standing outside in the cold and sprinkles. My grandmother is 79 and some of those people we're older than her. It's sad that this place is not big enough to accommodate the people coming here. I already know how long it takes. They should have been allowed to come in and at least stand on the wall if they decided to stay and I don't know what is wrong with the youth or men these days not to offer women or the elderly a seat.,1
"My god, your telephone hold music is deliberately horrible. There’s an earpiercing feedback whine, followed by what I assume is Kenny G played from a broken phonograph at the bottom of a well. High pitched screech every 8 seconds. I was physically unable to remain on hold because it was painful. I can’t imaging how it would be for someone with hearing aids. The automated menu options made no sense either. If your goal is to make people hang up before ever reaching a live customer service rep, then well played Kansas. Well played. My job duties require a lot of time on the phone with various states’ departments of revenue.  This was a bad experience. I only called because the letter you sent had no information on how to fix the issue. Take a tip from the Texas State Comptroller. They seem to have a pretty good system. And I don’t even like Texas.",1

"My experience with this place was awful! The guy who works there spent far to long loudly explaining why he couldn't help the person in front of me to them, so I didn't have a good feeling already. When it was finally my turn he skimmed over my documents and found a mediocre ""problem"" that meant he also could not help me. I have owned my vehicle for 5 years and not once have i ever had an issue registering it so why does he have one? Then on top of everything he got angry when I was asking questions to clarify what I needed to do to get it registered and was very rude and offensive. They've got a fish tank in the lobby that is as scummy as they are and I would seriously recommend going anywhere else. This man is trying to bring all the fun of going to the DMV right into his own little auto licensing agency.",1
My experience with the North Syracuse DMV was exceptional. During Covid-19 the department of motor vehicles used Social Distancing to keep us all safe.

Paperwork was filled out prior to actually being served, which saved a bunch of time. Everyone was very friendly. If you have to go to the BMV and want efficient, nice, people this is the place.",5
My experience was quite OK today (5th Oct 2021). They have two separate queues for people having appointment and other one for the walk-ins without appointment. Our wait time of 2 hours was not that bad considering we went without appointment. The staff were mostly cordial to us.,4

They're focused to serve fast. They talked a lot but do their job right. Which means fun workers & loved it.

Wishing them a great success.",5
"My experience was great! I had to go twice however, the staff was not(I was lol) a fault for my double trip.
When I got there and explained what I needed and realized I didn't have all the paperwork. I was direct to a location that would help me and a timely fashion and when I returned I was greeted with the same care and professional attitude. All the staff was so nice and worked hard to have me issue resolved",5

Don't get me wrong and I will try to explain everything to which is making me tell what I have to say. From the beginning of last year when I decided after 19 years of not having my license and depending on so call friends and also families for transportation and cabs,buses , Lyft and spending money for well been.

I don’t remember her name but I definitely give big thanks to her for her professionalism. Although one downside I would have to say is that the non-appointment line is pretty long and rarely moves so I recommend you should be there pretty early. But other than that, I definitely do recommend this DMV.",4

"My daughter and I live together and I agreed to pick up the car tags for her old SUV that had been recently repaired. (She has another car that she normally drives).  While waiting in the line, and older gentlemen was thanking the clerk for breaking her own rules on his behalf.  I thought that was kind of her.  I over heard another lady giving the birthdate of her son for whom she was picking up tags.  When I presented, the clerk informed me that I must show my daughters license, although, I had my daughter's car registration, cash and our addresses are the same.  Well, I thought,  rules are rules although obviously they are not applied consistently.  So I drove the five miles to get my daughter, who is recovering from eye surgery.  My daughter had to go to the restroom right before I was called, so she handed me her driver licensed, the cash again and the registration.  The Clerk insisted that I wait for my daughter to return from the restroom before she proceeds.  The first clerk informed us that the expiration date must remain July, although the car was not operating during that time and had the car not been driven during the months of July-November, the date would be November.    When my daughter advised her that it had only been driven to emissions and the miles required to reset the code after repair, the clerk went on to give a ""lecture"" about what is illegal driving on expired tags.  I''d had enough and just wanted to pay and get the heck out of the crazy place where rules applies to some, but not to all.  The overall experience was very poor and the staff all need to be trained in unconscious  bias and consistent treatment of customers, as it gives the public a reason to believe that the clerks inconsistent application of the rules has little to do with what is legal and the rules, and a lot more to do with who they wish to extend kindness.",1

Thank you for helping.  It's been months trying to settle brothers affairs with his vehicle and now I can thanks to the DMV.",5
"My brain is aching at some of the crazy planning that has been going on in the D. First, when companies receive bonuses for completing projects early,  do the companies have to return the bonuses and pay a fine when the roads begin to crack within 5 years? Second, whose bright idea was it to reduce Wyoming to one lane each way? It definitely wasn't the residents of the city! Nobody took in consideration about the traffic backups and accidents? Third, why can't each major intersections have a left turn signal? I could ask more but I will wait on a response from MDOT.",1
"My boyfriend came here this morning because he lost his ID… We heard rumors that we had to make an appointment for a replacement ID card… but we were in a hurry and we were in the area and we decided to check it out just in case. We walked in and there was hardly anyone there and he was in and out with a replacement temporary ID within five minutes. I think maybe if it was very busy they would’ve told us to make an appointment? But there was nobody there at 10:15 this morning.  Excellent service! I always make sure to write a review when I have a great quick and painless experience at any government office, as it is hard to come by!",5
My boyfriend and I went today. He had the card for my payment. I went  to the testing section to ask him for the card so I can pay. Then this lady behind the counter started to yell like crazy that I was giving him the answer. I tried to talk to her but she went on a crazy mode not trying to listen I explain her the reason I was close by him. Since we got there the lady in the front was very rude. The lady from receptionist she was very nice and help us.  I never being in such of situation it was embarrassing. How can you be like that it's outrageous.,1
"My boyfriend and I came in and all the LADIES here were amazing! They were FAST and friendly. Especially the receptionist in the front she had so much patience, (we were there for almost an hour, services for both of us, and she dealt with some rude clients, but she was so nice to them and helped everyone out the best she could.)

Keep in mind that as of now (Sept 2021) everything must be done by appointment which is why this visit was so easy. Maybe they should leave it as 'appointment only'....just a thought.",5

I find that amazing ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️with the old method it was a much longer wait. It is super organized now. You can come in and make your appointment or you can make your appointment online but you must have one to be able to do anything with your license. My situation was a renewal so I needed my Social Security card, my drivers license, and my passport, to meet the criteria for the new drivers license.
I wish I knew her name but I didn’t wanna ask because I feel like sometimes state employees get a little nervous when you do that ….so all I know is she was at the Counter 5 slot taking customers and she was extremely nice, efficient, polite, and very helpful. She had black short hair. Very, very personable!!!
So you either check in on your phone or on the computer and there is a form that requires a lot of information front and back and takes a few minutes to complete so be sure to look for that as I missed it until I was asked if I had one. Fortunately, the gentleman who was making sure that people who came in had appointments asked me if I had one and when I didn’t he got me one and a pen to complete it. He was another Public servant with a great attitude and customer service. I will mention that I also interacted with the lady at the computer because evidently I didn’t have to check in on the computer if I had already checked in on my phone but sometimes the directions are not perfectly clear and I probably misunderstood. She was also helpful.
The State of Texas Department of Public Safety has done an incredibly good job with the Covid restrictions in place.

Multiple queuing system.  Waited 90 minutes to be seen. Watch the queue TV carefully because the numbers jump ahead and jump back a lot. The office only takes cash luckily they have an ATM at the door. Charges $3.75 to withdraw max of $200. Use the wait time to fill in the forms.  Bonded titles require you purchase insurance which you can buy after this government office has instructed you to do so. Government processing fee is $15 for bonded titles.  Then Title Insurance is sold online but there is a company outside this office called A1 Surety bonds. They will match your online quotes so get one quote at least before going to them. Expect to pay $100 to $500 depending on vehicle value.  Once you have the permission to obtain bonded title and the insurance paperwork from surety company go back to your county tax office to obtain title and pay their taxes ad fees.,3
Multiple days in a row I have checked in early online to help me avoid waiting. And multiple days in a row I havent been called in.

Get your time sensitive vehicle documents elsewhere,1

Only bad experience I’ve had is one of the front desk ladies was kind of rude when she assumed I didn’t have the correct paperwork for what I was coming in for, but she quickly straightened up when she saw I had all the documents.",5
Much less busy than I last went . Even though my number was high it was about an HR wait. I was in and out of line quickly. You do have to wear a mask to go in and wait.

Much can be improved. Depending on the DMV representative some things can get done and some other can’t. Rules don’t seem to be applied uniformly and neither is the training. If only there were better ways to do some of the things. Be ready to have either a great experience or a terrible one depending on whom the representative is and how that representative feels that day.,3

Moved here from out of state.. while getting my TX registration I had to leave the office real quick to grab another document they needed.. the lady helping me out never gave me my NJ registration back before I left .. I said told her after I came back that I didn’t get it and she insisted that I have it. I asked her if she can look around her desk. She literally looked at her desk (without moving anything around) and just said “well it’s not here”. Lol she probably left it in the copy machine when she made a copy of it but she was so unwilling to even TRY TO LOOK ... my NJ registration is still at the office. To top it off the only way to contact the office is to physically go in. The number they have routes to a call center,1
Moved from out of state. Been in 3 times over the last month. Every time they tell me I need different documents than the last. I had them check my documents the first time and they said everything was fine other than 1 missing document. Came in a 2nd time with missing document and they said I was missing a new document. Came in the third time and they said I was missing a completely different document. I’ve been trying to get my license for 2 months and it seems they want to make it as difficult as possible on people from out of state.,1

Most pathetic group of people I've ever met in my life. They go above and beyond to make your day hard and to make the process as complicated as it could be. You can show up with 100 correct documents and they will still nitpick you to death And find a way to tell you your document isn't valid.  God forbid you move from another state because none of your documents will be valid. Its like  this is another country and they all bow down to Frankfort as if it's some holy entity. Having a driver's license and an ID is an essential part of everyday living and they make this nearly impossible for you and charge ridiculous fees. Fully taking advantage of people. I don't know how these people could even feel good about the work they do screwing people over.

Price of sale stated does not matter. Does not matter if your vehicle does not run, they will use their own market value price regardless. They say it is from Edmunds, but again, not true at all. Take your title elsewhere outside of the city. MOST OF THE PEOPLE HERE ARE LIARS AND THIEVES!!!!",1
Most everyone was very helpful even the day the system went down. The next day came in my paperwork had been checked told me I had everything I needed. The young person that help me made me feel like I was supposed to know everything before she said it. I'm hard and hearing try to explain that she made me feel like I was bothering her by coming in to get my license updated. She is definitely not customer service oriented.

Mike's Driving School was amazing. Easy 5 stars. The classroom was very informative and Elvis is a great instructor. He made sure we understood everything before moving onto the next subject. In cars were easy to book and Mike was great during the in cars. Easy to converse with which made the in car experience comfortable. He goes into detail about how you can perfectly pass your MVA road test. Would highly recommend the school to anyone.,5
Mike's driving school is a great school with awesome instructors. They are really funny and pleasant and the dull classes become more fun and seems less painfully long with them. I recommend Mike's also because they care about how you drive and teach you very easy ways to pass the test. I have never parallel parked before and they made it so easy for me to learn and do. Mike's adds a new twist to teaching that makes driving easy. The price is also affordable.,5

But I want to thank you for the Vermont Registration for my out of state vehicle that I desperately needed for my state's Title application.  Because of your plates I am now able to get my car titled in my state.  You guys are the best!  Thank you.

Being the Vermont DMV responded to my review, I am under the assumption this is being read as well.  I have a question:  I did in fact receive my Vermont plates, however the registration card and sticker have not arrived yet.  May I kindly ask when I should expect those two items?  My plates arrived less than a week ago.  Thank you in advance for any insight.",5

I've had the pleasure of working with her one multiple occasions since 2021 began and each time she has been wonderful to work with. If you need to title a vehicle go here! As long as you have your paperwork and cash for notary, it will take you no time! Please look up the documents needed to title a vehicle on the NCDMV page, they have everything you need listed there.

"Long lines. Apparently less than other locations, most of the time. I spent a total of 2 hours in line today. There is basically no way to know if you need something else until you've already gone through the line, assigned a number and called up again. I had all required documents to transfer a vehicle to SC but the title was missing a signature (not my fault). Had to leave, get necessary documentation and go back and proceed with the line again.  3 of the 5 employees I had interactions with were extremely nice. If you can do anything online though, do it. Pay the extra fees.",2

Long lines only one person doing titles even though others are using different letters to be seen faster n paperwork not completed or signed by the right people.   They need help too many vehicles without tags or paper tags ... Just 😢 sad,1
Long lines but in and out quick once your number gets called! Women there a kind of rude literally not a smile from any of them no matter how nice I was to them. I know public service isn't always easy and people aren't always nice but when they are you could at least reciprocate it. Especially since I talked to four different people and not one of them was friendly unless they were talking to each other.,3

However, to my surprise, the line was short & fast moving!!  I was in & out in about 45 minutes. 😁 I arrived at 11:30 & was out by 12:12.  The appointment line wasn't any faster to get inside the building & once inside there are plenty of chairs available & there is a snack stand for munchies & drinks.",5

She tells you how to do the EASY stuff yourself, whether new resident or old:   (1) Get insurance, easily done over the phone (2) Get a smog check  (3)  Go to DMV drivethrough for VIN check...you are IN AND OUT fast...this is NOT like going INSIDE at all, and no appointment needed.

After that she does the rest that is such a time consuming pain in the behind for the rest of us, including getting the plates.  Don't get ripped off...there are a lot of sharks in Vegas waiting to rip you off.",5

Kiosk works just fine. Perfect if you want to skip the line for a simple renewal or small inquiries.,5
Kiosk works great! Registration renewal is extremely easy on these machines. They have 2 machines here. And the best part is that it takes payments in the form of card or cash! Which is awesome! Most of the kiosks around town only accept cards. And it's very user friendly. It walks you through the whole process. I was done and gone within about 5 minutes. No more waiting in long lines for me for now on!,5
"Kiosk is inside AAA insurance. They close at 5pm.  But wont let you in After 450pm. Total bs... 3rd place that has wrong kiosk information, either broken down for several months the with no idea of when they will fix or there is no kiosk.. or they closed, very frustrating..",1

Instead of answering our question and helping us for not understanding she got loud and kept being smart asking ""did you get this paper?""

"Just moved here, and purchased a vehicle in my previous state before moving. Went to register my vehicle at Bel-Red within 30 days (as the law says) and was told I now owed thousands in 'use tax', even though I had already paid sales tax and registration fees in the state I departed, because it hadn't been 90 days since I bought the car. This 'use tax' thing seems like a scam, but numerous calls to the Dept. of Revenue to understand why I owed more tax were unhelpful to say the least. However, at Bel-Red, I was helped by Reuben and, long story short(ish) - he was great from start to finish (took a couple of days), explained the situation, provided me some options to try, and then caught a mistake in the calculations that ended up saving me about $800 I didn't actually owe. Reuben took extra time and effort to help a stranger, and it was much appreciated - thank you very much, Reuben!! (sorry if I spelled your name wrong!)",5

"Just had my 4th big MVD committed and  admitted error over the years, which once again has cost me time and money.  MVD has systemic issues, has for years which they are never adequately addressed or solved.  Long hold times, inaccurate information by employees, computers down a lot, not mailing items to you, or in a timely manner and sometimes to wrong address.  If they make mistakes and admit it, you have to apply on line for the refund,  Why not refund while I am standing at the counter at MVD?    Or if on the telephone and an employee knows there's an obvious error, which does not even require new paperwork to correct, not make me go to their offices.  Their system is flawed, inefficient,  and no one seems to really care or do anything.  Major overhaul needed, top down.",1

The level of sloth and nonchalance they move with is remarkable. Anywhere else, they would be fired for lack of productivity. 6 employee counters handling 6 people every 20 minutes, or so.

I was about 20-25th in line or so already, so I was like, dang, but I had to get it done, so I of, course, waited. People in line were talking about how they had come at other times the previous week and the lines were way longer. Once the doors opened, I was pleasantly surprised, though. A gentleman had come out while were were waiting for them to open to take our names to put on a list. When we walked in we were directed to a lobby to wait until our names were called. We could see where we were at on the list and how many people were ahead of us on screens inside. They also have a television program on if you wanted to watch that. Another employee sat in the lobby with us and called out the names and window numbers as they came up, so you didn't have to worry about missing your name if you weren't looking at the screen. The list of names seemed to go through pretty steadily, and I was called, got my stuff taken care of, and walked out. When I looked down at my phone's time, I found that I had been inside about an hour and a half, though I was actually kind of surprised it was this long, as it really didn't seem like it. I think they've got a good system in place. The employees were all friendly and professional. I think they've just got to get it streamlined a little bit more, which I'm sure takes a bit of time to figure out. Once they do, I think it will be a fairly fast and efficient experience.",4

Let me start out by saying the individual who did help me was pleasant, efficient and friendly.  But, today I experienced some outright rudeness.  Rude lady number one:  It wasn't particularly crowded, just a few people.
You saw me there.   I was right in front of you and was patiently waiting for you to call me to your window.  Nope, you decided that now was the perfect time to rearrange tabs in boxes. It wasn't a quick operation. You didn't even acknowledge me; just a quick, ""I'll be right with you"", would have made all the difference.  But no, just a glare and then staring down at your box of tabs.  Rude lady number two, again, no acknowledgement, nothing.  Just turned your back and WALKED AWAY.  The young lady who did help was a gem.  You need more like her.  I am hoping it was just an off day, but some of your staff need some customer service training.",3

"It's very important that you check their website prior to arriving.
The office closes at 4pm, but you need to be in line by 3pm to be admitted if there is a long wait (which it seems there always will be).
This office is also only open every other week right now- they alternate weeks with the Outer Loop location. The schedule for which week the office is open is on the website as well.
I arrived at 2:30 pm on a Friday and was able to get my license address changed and get back out to my truck by 4pm- so I highly recommend you arrive by 2:30 pm at the latest.
If by some miracle there is no line, you would most likely be in and out within 10 minutes. The ladies running the place today were very straightforward and kind.
They have a small staff who are trying their best- they have a somewhat larger crew staffing the place earlier in the day, so you may be able to get in and out quicker then, but I'd plan on spending at least an hour and a half here total.",5

Next to American Family Insurance Office.  Lien release cost $15.00 for clear title, $25.00 for replacement titles. This was good to know info.",5

Its a great school I took years ago. For those of you that said the school doesn’t do much. Like teaching freeways and all that. I mean that’s something you can learn on your own. Parallel parking too. My first day of work years ago I was still a little rusty driver but I just did it and it became the norm. It’s just something you practice. Good school all in all,5
It's a great place to go if you don't want large crowds,3
It's a great hospital to take your kids,5

"It's a dmv, no likes going to them, in hindsight though the experience wasn't as bad as some I've had to visit. The staff seemed friendly enough albeit direct and to the point, I wish though their website was more user friendly and able to help people get all the forms they need before going. That would have to be my biggest complaint.",4
"It's a DMV and you're still a number, but it's the most efficient DMV I've ever been to. I'm taking a star off because nothing is getting cleaned in between people. The pens, the eye test (pressing your face against it), the touch screens you take the written test on, none of it is getting cleaned. Take hand sanitizer with you. That aside, the counters are all staffed, so lines move quickly compared to my experience at other DMV sites. I recommend setting up an appointment. If you need title or registration services, the appointment is required.",4
"It's a BMV, so maybe I should take that more into consideration.... but.... this place stinks. Poor customer service, not efficient/timely either.",1
Its 7:15 with 20 people in line. Its supposed to open at 7am and the doors are still locked. This has nothing to do with being understaffed. Just trash the whole thing is trash. Employee with long gray hair strolls in at 7:40 with her QT drink. It's still closed. Trash i tell you!!! Fix your hours!!! The door says they open at 8!!!! They DO NOT OPEN AT 7!,1

"It’s refreshing to see people enjoying their job. Back when there was a long line for drivers license renewals they took appointments to the first dozen people lined up in the morning. This was actually to help people not wait in line for a long time. But they happened to be ahead of schedule the day I came in and worked me in since I didn’t know about that process. I saw them allow several other people in too, with thumbs up signs back and forth to each other. This was all above and beyond their normal process (so don’t count on it) and it increased their workload but must’ve made the time go by faster. She even refused a tip I offered.",5
"It’s really a shame how horrible the customer service is here. Just call them, you’ll see.. The lady who sits in the front and registers the vehicles acts like she never wants to be there, and that’s exactly how she treats you. This place is exhausting, just go to DMV.",1
It’s not working,1
"It’s not saving any time, they messed up my license, and now I have to go all the way across town for plates, too?  Put all the car stuff in one building where it is convenient. Plus, if so many windows saves time, why aren’t those windows staffed? This system is ridiculous.",1

"It’s a yellow kiosk located by Meijer’s customer service counter. It was easy to use. The machine charges a $3.95 service fee, and  there’s a 2.3% fee charged for using your debit/credit card (which is the only option since cash isn’t accepted right now). It will even print a receipt for your transaction. I will use it the next time I need to renew my car tags - there was no line!!",5
It’s a typical DMV. Out of date systems and long wait times. What can you do...,2
"It’s a shame how much taxes they collect from us and the type of service they provide!  Don’t understand how the rest of the city is running close to normal but when you need a registration stick they can’t see you! Ridiculous I was told to go online and once I asked for a manager they let me inside, they were only accepting 30% capacity! There was 1 yes 1 person being helped inside! Don’t understand what kind of employees are “running” the city! Oh but don’t be late bc you can’t use the COVID excuse like they do!",1
"It’s a neat old building and the cannons out front add a nice touch. Pretty cool for a municipal building, I think.",5
"It’s a goose chase! Make sure you are there early like 6AM but be ready to be told they may have to call you back. The documents they are requesting — PRINT THEM OUT! While we are living 2021, many state and government agencies are still living in the 80s and need to copy/scan everything. The upside to this location, the workers are EXTREMELY nice! Very pleasant and seems happy to be at work. I was greeted and wished a great day each visit.
Good luck!!!",3
"It would have been better but the young women who work the vehicle registration area didn't tell anyone that we didn't need a number to get service.  So many people stood in line waiting for a number to be called. Finally, someone from the Courthouse who was there stated we didn't need a number and we got service from a very, aloof young lady.  They should be more proactive than socializing with themselves.  Yes, there was a sign posted in a hard to see area.  The place looked dirty and not very well maintained.",3
"It would be nice if someone would actually answer the phone. I called for 3 weeks and no one answered. I just decided to make an appointment, and while there, I could hear the phone ringing non stop and no one would answer it.
I’m transferring my title from another state, and have had the title sent twice by my lien holder, but no one can seem to find it. It has been 2 months! It’s extremely frustrating..
I gave 3 stars because although dealing with the MVD has been very frustrating, the people that work there are very kind and give great customer service once you actually get to see someone.",3

My mother probably knew but she accidentally forgot her wallet since we were in a rush. So I told the lady who attended me to please wait, but she responded and said you’re going to have to wait. Okay well I understand it’s our fault ,but then she proceeds to talk about it to another worker while I can hear them. For me that was not very nice. The whole experience wasn’t bad per say but just remember to get everything because people are busy , but also for the workers to please not talk about it when the person can hear you.",3

There was only 4 windows open and for it being a regional office, there should have been more staff working. They need to have a better system for taking care of walk-in customers.",1

"It was kind of a mixed experience, Robin was extremely helpful and pretty much helped me in every way she could. I think she was awesome, the woman that checked me in was a different woman.

She was older (50-60) and heavyset. I had spoken to Robin over the phone before coming there and after waiting to be called up to the counter for almost 30 minutes I was hoping I would go to her but instead I went to this older woman. Immediately she challenged whether I should be there or not. She claimed I didn't have the right documentation to get my car tags.. This is the day after Robin told me over the phone I had everything I needed and to come on in.. She seemed very rude and gave me the impression she couldn't wait for me to leave. She told me I need to come back after I have the right paperwork and there was nothing she could do with what I had.

I basically had to argue with her that Robin said otherwise.. After Robin basically vouched for me, the old woman practically snapped out of it and started being nice and friendly all of the sudden. After that I didn't have any issues in I got taken care of everything I had come in there to do. Though I can't help but wonder how the experience would have gone if Robin wasn't there, or if I hadn't already spent hours on the phone tracking down exactly what I needed..

Overall it's a decent place but I'd say your experience will certainly vary depending on who checks you in, if I go back I would definitely wait to go with Robin",3
It was just a short wait to be seen. Social distancing is in effect and mask mandate as well. They are thorough with the information.,5
It was horrible. It was my 4 the visit they need a better system. It was very inconvenient and frustrating,1
It was helpful that I was able the use one of the kiosks. They had multiple available for use.,5

It was a great test experience. The guy I got was super nice. The test was like 7 minutes and I passed. Just practice and feel confident. The biggest piece of advice is to look around. I made  a few mistakes that might have cost me the test if it wasn’t for me looking around honestly.other than that I wouldn’t feel nervous if your going to take a test here as long as you have a little of driving experience,5

It was  disaster they don't have appt till January! And theyhv tobe made by phone I'm a senior no one offered me accommodations Total desrespect no comapation or accommodations!,1
It waited in line 6 feet apart. 5 people ahead of me and it took about 1/2 hour. Friendly and safe wear a mask!,5
"It used to be an ""MVA Express"" with little to no wait. You now have to make an appointment for all MVA in person services. It's amazing that no one has figured out how to improve the efficiency of these places. A root canal is more fun.",1
It took me months to get an appointment with the DMV for a license and when I got there they told me that my Out of state drivers license has been canceled....,4
"It took me less than an hour to get all of my documents verified, take a photo, and get a driver's license. Everyone was friendly and professional. I have no complaints!",5
"It took me 40 minutes to do 5 minutes of work.  Most was waiting time.  I was three minutes late because the office had been moved since my last visit.  Good social distancing was maintained, the service staff were friendly and efficient once it got to be my turn to do business.",3
It took forever. People friendly.,4
It took about twenty minutes from door to door and the service was great. WAY better than the 21st location,5
"It took 90 minutes from start to finish for my daughter to get her license. The examiner said she must have had a good teacher. I really like that guy. Give him a raise. All staff we interacted with were nice polite and not sloth like at all. I was really surprised. Overall,  I would recommend the DMV for all of your motor vehicle needs.",4

They were just passing other people through with out filling that yellow paper out but of course my time to fill it out they decide to start making people do it again. So almost 2 months no food. Homeless, and my stroke surviving fiancee is being kept locked away by a care home that has done everything they can to keep me away since they found out I was homeless. Love my life....",2

It looks like a beautiful building but the police standing outside without their badge numbers or names visible is very threatening. Why hide your name if you aren't going to brutalize citizens? When asked to kneel in protest they all refused. It's almost as if they aren't to protect and serve us. Fortunately the citizens nearby were all extremely helpful offering free water and hand sanitizer.,3
It isn't the worst BMV I've been to!! Really neat building and staff is friendly. Treat them the way you want to be treated and its a pretty smooth process,5
It is worth the drive to Dowagiac. There is no excuse for this kind of poor service. Only people from Illinois where they pay through the nose for...,1
It is what it is. Know your book and maneuvers and you are good. Examiners are professional and fair. They give advice on your weak points and encourage you to try again.,5

"It is shameful. On the NCDOT website, it states that an appointment is not required. I go to the DMV and find two people waiting outside in the heat because they were told if they didn't have an appointment,  that is where they have to wait. As I am disabled and have difficulties walking or standing, I went inside (just had a couple of questions and couldn't get anyone to answer the phone) and found what appeared to be a fully staffed office with plenty of empty chairs for people to use and still have properly socially distance. When I came through the door,  I was immediately asked if I had an appointment.  Not hi, how can we help you,  then depending on the answer ask if they have an appointment and explain that they are booked (something like that). What happened to common courtesy, especially to someone with a disability???  I was told to wait where I was. With empty seats and told to wait where I was (standing 5 to 10 feet from a chair) one again shows the lack of common courtesy. When someone finally did ask me what I needed, I stated that I just had a couple of questions.  They told me I would be better off getting on the website instead of waiting around to be seen and possibly not be seen at all. To say the least,  it will be a cold day in hell before I go back there again.",1
It is really annoying that they do not answer phones. Especially when you have a very quick and simple question. What do they expect? You to drive down to their location and wait in the line of 25 people just to get an answer? Waste of time.,1
"It is really a hit or miss here. There are lots of pros to this location. It is a big newer building, with a rather large parking lot that includes a training area. Ez pass questions can be dealt with here as well as other motor vehicle needs. Cons would be long wait times even at the door. There was also a time where I had come in to get identification and I brought all my documents. The woman at the desk refused me and sent me off to get another document. I went out and got it. I came back to a different employee and she did not require the new document the other employee requested. She went down her checklist and confirmed I had brought everything I was supposed to. So that can be frustrating.",4
It is not working properly. I scanned my registration notice and then asked me for my driver license. I scanned my card but it keeps telling me that it cannot find my license. We allowed the next person in line and it did the same thing for them. YOU NEED TO FIX it!,1
It is not a dmv,1

"It is located in Kroger, and works great if you want to renew your tab.

It will charge extra $3.95 for using this station, and 2.3% charge for credit card transactions.",5
"It is impossible to get through on the telephone number given out for making appointments. Either put in some kind of waiting queue answering system or dump the phone number for appointments.

The on line sign up requires something in the ""notes"" section at the end to allow the app to finish.  There are no instructions as to what information should go there. I made up something just to get finished.  Also, the on-line appointment calendar may show no available appointments for a month but if you show up tomorrow morning. There will be openings. If there are openings, why not show them.

Michael in the Sioux City office was great!   Knowledgeable, friendly, and courteous. While I was at his station a foreign gentleman who had failed his test and needed to make another appointment came to the window.  His command of English was very limited and he was confused about getting an appointment as quickly as possible.  Michael asked him to have a seat and he would walk him through getting an appointment set up. A very upset man was now very relieved. It was a pleasure working with him.",5
"It is impossible to get simple information from the online site, and if you call the number that is listed for the Newport office, you get a recording  where you are still unable to speak to a human being.I know Vermont has a small population, but surely they could find some real people to answer simple questions. The recorded information is generally unhelpful.",1
It is going well with what they have to work with. Great job.,5
It is a DMV what are you expecting?,3
It is a cruel scenario that every year for my birthday month my car tag expires. I should be celebrating and opening presents and trying not to feel so old....,4
It has very respectful people i was handcuffed and taken into a jail cell with nice loving inmates rate 10/10 would get arrested again 👍🏾,4
"It has improved a little bit from the last time I visited the place.  The last time I went there, it was pure chaos! This time, I went there to renew my license and it ran smoothly.  The staff is still overwhelmed but that's expected with so many people.  But I appreciated their hard work.  With that being said, some of the staff and the security guards need to work on their manners.  Why are you even working there if you're just going to rude to the customers?  Just work on the customer service skills, which will be beneficial to you and your customers!!",3

It feels weird leaving a good review for a BMV 😬. There is a spirit of cooperation and “we’ll get through this together” at this location not sure who is responsible as the two ladies who helped me were equally responsive and pleasant. If you have a bad experience at this place …it’s probably you (just sayin). Way to go team! -Not meant ironically,5

"It costs $35.50 to get a new title that will take 8-10 weeks to process. It costs $85.50 for quick title. I needed my title immediately and paid the $85.50 to get it asap. In the WA state Licensing website it states that when you purchase a quick title that it will be processed immediately. So after a month I called them asking where was my title. They said they never received my info. Then they call me back stating that they missed placed my info and are processing the title.
I then ask them to reimburse for $50.00 because they lost my information and the process took over 45 days. 45 days is not immediately. Battle Ground Auto License refused to reimburse me. Don't let this happen to you. Save your time and money and go somewhere else. They basically ripped me off for $50.00 and don't have a care in the world about it.",1

conveniently  there is no way to reach the registry to file a complaint I have no idea of what to do I have informed the customer i also called my insurance company they checked and the car is not registered so the call was a lie and they lost the paperwork. Its great that these people have NO ACCOUNTABILIY FOR THERE ACTIONS AND YOU CANT REACH ENYONE WHILE IT IS WELL KNOWN THAT THE rmv IS RUDE AND HAS NO INTEREST IN CUSTOMER SERVICE BUT NOW THEY CAN ACT WITH IMPUNITY AND NO CONSEQUENCES FOR THE ACTIONS ALSO THE MANAGER REFUSED TO IDENTIFY HERSELF SINCE I HAVE NO WAY TO REACH ANYBODY AT THE REGSTRYAND HAVE BEEN GIVEN NO PATH TO COMPLETE THE TRANSACTION I HAVE INFORMED MY CUSTOMER",1

But having spent my morning there and observing that there is more to it than meets the eye, I figure that tag agency's have been given a rough deal and are doing what they can with what they have been handed. Anyway, my case was a rare and semi unique one, but Brittany/Brittney went out of her way to figure out how she should handle my Real ID application. I was very impressed at her kindness and willingness to go the extra mile, not only for me, but those that was in line in front of me also.",5
"I'm sure all employees are doing their best, but their scheduling system needs immediate overhaul. Expect to wait ""on standby"" all day and to drop everything and rush over there. To get started, you must sign in online within minutes of the office opening (7:30). They give you an estimated wait. 4 hours later, my estimated wait time was longer than when it started. An hour later, my wait was an hour and 45 minutes. 30 minutes later, I was supposed to walk up to window 13. I hadn't even left the house yet! They politely told me I missed my window and I would have to get in line again. To their credit, I was able to join the front of the wait list once arriving. Of course, the front of the wait list means you have to sit in line in person for an indeterminate period.",1

My examiner (the one with shaved hair)unfortunately I can't remember the name of course is also very professional! I didn't feel so stressed while examining!and I passed with my first try!!!

"I'm putting two stars because there are two really lovely employees who have been kind, helpful, and I appreciate them so much. I don't have one of their names, one is Travis and he is just lovely. However the regional manager of this DMV is not only extremely rude, but has made what has turned into a *year and a half* of phone calls and paper work an actual nightmare. It's a real shame because it's obvious the people working under her are doing their best to help the public, but because of this woman who clearly gets a power trip from making things extraordinarily difficult, everything suffers. If it weren't for these other two folks, I'd absolutely rate it 1 star.

***EDIT: Thank goodness I had the wherewithal to go to the DMV in Jamestown where in less than an hour, I was helped and walked out with a license. The Mayville DMV was adamant that I needed to get a learner's permit and take an entire road test rather than help me with my license issue. Unbelievable that after all this time and multiple visits/phonecalls/paperwork, my issue was resolved in one quick visit at a different DMV. If you can avoid going to this location, I highly suggest you do. Ill informed, unhelpful and a massive waste of time and energy. These people were really going to have me take a road test and get a learner's permit for a VERY easy to solve issue. Terrible experience.",2

I was able to get my transaction done, however. I'm really glad that I only have to go once a year. this was actually a 0-star experience, but I won't let it affect my week.",1

I have paid taxes for many years and here's what I think... if our tax dollars can pay for politicians to eat $1000 a plate dinners and $20,000 suits, then ANY US citizen living below poverty, should get food stamps, no questions asked. And let's not forget, that all US born citizens have a federally bonded birth certificate worth roughly 2 million dollars (give or take based on the economy) and that is a 2 million dollar promisary note that in exchange for our citizenship, providing economical benefits to the country, they would keep us healthy, educated, fed and housed.  ...FAIL!!!

So I really don't get the whole appointment thing because I could tell that the staff was just as confused as the rest of us.",1

If you get a moving violation actually go to court even if you're guilty. If its your first offence they'll double the fine and it wont appear on you record. Its well worth it considering speeding tickets and most moving violations will make your insurance go up 30-60% for the next few years. You dont have to go up to a judge infront of everyone and explain yourself they have a prosecuter there who basically explains your options privately and basically gives you the choice to go in front of a judge and fight it or pay double and get it expunged.,5

This location is efficient. Most of the folks there are friendly and try to take care of things efficiently. My title transfer took about 10 minutes and I was out the door.

You make an appointment only to be served 3 hours after your appointment time.   They even sent a text to stay in my car until served but never sent another.

Then she said she didn’t liked the way I talk. Off course I have an accent.

Anyway I took the case seriously and asked her name since she didn’t put on a badge. Then she said “ this is a private company so I don’t need a badge” what? Anyway that skinny short lady with an accent and tattoos took a copy of my ID and any kind of identity theft that could happen to me could most likely because of her.

"I’m waiting for renewal on my CDL, you shouldn’t have to wait in line for renewal. There should be a line for renewal only, it’s very inconvenient for people’s to have to sit and wait on people that need to take exam, or road test.
It’s terrible in Mississippi for any form of licensing renewal.
This situation needs to be re-examine and try to find a solution to this problem.
Maybe you need to get your transportation commissioner involved to assess a better route.",1
"I’m very professional and I carry myself very well. Certain staff members there are rude, I came for service, not to make anyone’s job harder than what it is, and I sure didn’t go there to be talked to in a unmannerly way after being told over the phone to come in person and stood in line over an hour to get told something totally different once I finally got inside. No matter what I always keep my composure and I make sure I’m always respectful. I hope y’all get it together and stop taking people kindness for weakness because you clearly don’t know what others have been thru in life. Show some consideration.",1
I’m trying to get my instate license. Have tried 3 times getting there 2 hrs before it opens and still have not gotten an appointment. Worst setup ever. Rude employees and won’t answer questions,1
"I’m super impressed with this location and all of its workers. I made an appointment online, filled out the forms online and showed up about 20 minutes early. I realized I forgot my proof of citizenship so after they kindly checked to see if it was in the system and couldn’t find it, they gave me a blue wrist band and told me to go home and get it and come right back - which I did. When I returned they saw me within 10 minutes. All 3 workers I had interacted with were very respectful, nice and super kind! From the moment I walked in with all the documents I was finished with my license renewal in 20 minutes time. Very professional and very organized. I was super impressed because we all know how it used to be in the past!",5

"I’m just putting this as an FYI out there to all parents that enters this courthouse. I’ve never been in court in any other county so I’m not sure if it’s routine or what.

I know that mediation for custody is routine and mandatory for 1 of 2 family court judges. However, if you have concerns with the other parent having 50/50 custody; substance abuse, alcoholism, unfit, safety issues, instability, etc., from my experience; the mediator(s) (These parent’s had two) will persuade and insist that you must agree to the other parent having “more” parenting/visiting days so that he/she will “fall on their face” with the time. Meaning, if this parent is as bad as you say, you will agree to he/she having 3-5 days a week + several overnights and let them prove they’re bad. Completely avoiding the actual safety risks that puts the child in harms way, they will tell you that this is the way to go to prove yourself. They will tell you that you do not want to go to court because the other parent will get 50/50 despite the concerns, and this is the easier way out. They will calculate up the hours in a week, split it for 50/50 vs what you are agreeing to, and tell you that this is so much less time for the other parent. You will sign the order and it’s very difficult to get out of it. When you go in front of the judge and try to bring up all of the said issues, the judge will tell you that if these issues were so concerning, you should have never signed an agreed order for other parent to have the child unsupervised x amount of days of the week. You will NOT be permitted to explain yourself. The order will remain in effect and even if the other parent had fallen on their face, they don’t care. If you have a case similar to the one I witnessed, and you go to mediation a second time or third time, the mediator and others will yet again, tell you to agree to all of this parenting time for the parent to “fall on their face” and screw it up... again... supposedly. The fit parent that I knew, WISED UP. They did NOT agree to more “bait” of an agreement. THIS IS HOW THEY GET THE OTHER UNSTABLE/UNSAFE PARENT 50/50 CUSTODY AND ONCE YOU HAVE IT, IT IS VERY DIFFICULT TO GET OUT OF THE ORDER.",1
"I’m honestly only giving them a one star because they were on time. I called prior to my appointment to make sure I had all of the right documents. I did not have my title and I explained that to the woman and she told me to bring different documents and that would be sufficient. Of course, when I get there that was not the case. I think that they do not take the time to listen and give people accurate information. It’s very unfortunate, it would save a lot of time for both parties they cared enough to provide the right information.",1

I’m actually surprised by some of these 1 Star reviews but not surprised at all to see so many people just using bad communication and not going through the process correctly. I’ve been helped by some of the nicest ladies I’ve even met at this location and haven’t hadn’t anything bad to say so far. Just come correct with a decent attitude and have your paperwork in line and they’ll treat you as equals. If you come in with a bad attitude and start throwing accusations you’re going to get that negative energy back...big surprise right?,5

Called earlier in the week and was told I could do a walk-in for a license renewal if I showed up before 1pm on a given day.
Figured today (Thursday) I could blow my lunch break and get in to have this done.
Physically arrive around 11:45 to find the shop locked - told that they are spraying sanitizer for cleanliness.
Hang out for over 30 minutes before they unlock the door. By this time there are about 20 people waiting to get in. Step foot inside to find that they are no longer doing walk-ins for the day.
Could they have not posted that on the glass doors to save me my lunch break?",1
"I’d like to know how much longer does the DMV intend on operating at such a reduced rate. Licensing a vehicle is easily an hour wait. Lines standing outside the door, lines in the drive thru. As a State Taxpayer I find it to be unacceptable!!",1

They just told me to mail my documents to the Richmond office even though the DMV letter indicated I can present documents and request my title at the nearest DMV Customer Service Center. Never go here! They wasted my time and they’ll do the same to you. I suggest going to another DMV location with more competent staff.,1
I would not listen to all of these 5 star reviews. I have had to drive up to this location about 5  times in the process of getting my new license. Every time I have been up there every single worker has been incredibly rude and unhelpful giving the least amount of information possible and absolutely not explanation for all the hoops I've had to go through. I also overheard the driving instructors talking negatively about people who had taken the test. If you can go to any other location I would.,1

The whole process was complete in less than two weeks. I will be going to ABS instead of the DMV whenever possible. If you want to save time, give ABS DMV Services a try.

"I would consider paying more for a storage unit that isn't a part of this chain.  It's kind of jenk here.  When we first moved in there was a gate to keep out strangers.  You used a key code to get through the gate. That's how self storage works, right?

Fast forward 6 or so months and we returned to check in on our unit and the gate was wide open.  Hmm, that's weird.  They must be working on it or something.

...We return 3 months later.  This time there is no gate.

...We finally move out almost 6 months after finding the gate open and it is still wide open.  This would be easier to stomach if there was a keypad or lock on the door to access the inside storage units, but there isn't one.  Not once during this time did the company contact us to tell us there was absolutely no security the entire way from the gate to the front door of our unit.  That is simply unacceptable for a storage company.

Additionally, the temperature was closer to 50 degrees, so it is not well insulated and not keeping up well with the cold.

Edit: In response to the owner's sudden concern about the gate being left open: we contacted red dot in the midst of this experience and were told there was no ETA on fixing it and that we would not be compensated for the downgraded security measures.",2

Once you have your ticket, they still give people with appointments priority over you. But do not give up. I was done at about 11:15am. It was a long process. I was also informed that they take walk ins on Tuesdays and Thursdays. Their Saturday hours have been suspended for now.

"I will no longer attempt to use this office. Twice now I am tried and failed to utilize this office for a title transfer on used vehicles. The first time I was told that they couldn’t help me because we had waited too long to transfer the title into our name after purchasing a used vehicle. This was not the case, the seller had poor handwriting and the date was a little hard to read however in my opinion it was still legible. But because the representative couldn’t read it they told me they couldn’t help. The second time I went there to transfer a title which was just this past week, I was again told that they couldn’t help and that I had to apply for a bonded title. This time the seller made an actual mistake on the title. They had already dated the sale of the vehicle from a couple of months ago. I tried to explain that the seller was going to sell it to another individual and dated it already, but then sold it to me instead and I had purchased it just a week ago. She never asked if I had a Bill of sale, nor did she offer any advice other than to apply for a bonded title. After I left I called another one of their locations and the young lady I spoke to over the phone recommended that I go to the tax assessor office because they can often times do more to help out. I was given better service in that three minute conversation over the phone than the 10 minutes that I had spent with the young lady at this location. When I went to the tax assessors office they advised me that they couldn’t fix the mistake but due to Covid any normal penalties that would normally apply are waived. I was able to get my title transferred with no penalties and now I’m a happy owner of a nice used truck.",1

"I will always go here whenever I need to renew my license or do anything DMV related. The staff is always very helpful.

Pre-COVID, I never had to wait very long to do what I had to do. Whether it was transferring a title, getting a passport, or renewing my license, I'm always assisted quickly compared to other DMVs I've been to.

I visited during COVID and they still were doing a phenomenal job. Although the wait in line outside was long, once I was inside I was done within 10 minutes. Throughout the wait an employee came outside and made sure we had all the necessary paperwork and that we were ready once we were inside. Once inside she directed everyone where to go and was very informative when people had questions.",5
"I will admit that it was my fault for losing my title.  But, when I moved out of state. The process to get a title re-issued took over a month and a half.  Every time I would send them the paperwork.  They would find one little error, that could have been easily corrected on their end, but they chose to mail it back.

When I finally got my replacement title in the mail. Whoever put it in the envelope stuck the glue of the envelop on the title, and it caused it to rip.  Now I have to start the entire process again.

Beware of this place",1
"I went without an appointment to renew my license and was in and out in less than an hour. The employees were very nice.

I went up there two days in a row because I continued to bring the wrong papers to pay my title. On both occasions I interacted with the same person her name was Brittany not only did she not make me feel bad for being all Over the place but she also made sure I got out in time to get my kids picked up! She walked outside with me to check the tag. It’s honestly all the little things that count in customer service. I’ve gone here for years but after this specific time I needed to put it out there!!! Thank you Brittany,5

I showed them many Social Security letters I had received but none were accepted. I left without a drivers licence!!

I went to the office today to get my mom handicap tag.  I was informed I needed to go and get my power of attorney for her and I will have to get back in line.  I went back home and came back with her original sealed power of attorney with my mom original signature…I told the lady several times that she gave me back the copy and not original.  She  proceeded to to ensure me that I had the document that I came in with.  I am soo upset that I didn’t push it further.  I will now have to take my mother who is an ampute back to the attorney office to get another original copy.  If I could rate below a zero I would.  If you want to resolve and give me back the original document I would sooo appreciate.  Otherwise I will see if there is anything I can do to proceed with this dispute. If I am not contacted some how I will take this as you really don’t give a darn.  My name Sheila Smith.  My mom is Willie Mae smith.  Something needs to be done about this.,1
"I went to the office today and they were very impersonal once you entered. The lady at the door was really nice. Remember to ask for a Real ID if that's what you want because they don't even ask if you need a regular or Real ID. They just do the regular ones and keep going. Then you have to pay $5 for a correction, once the ID comes  in the mail. Totally not good customer service since people don't know the difference. Especially if they will be required soon. I had to call and get placed on hold 3 times to get someone to answer the question once I realized there are 2 different IDs.",2

She made sure I had her contact information and returned calls and emails.

I feel that that is discriminatory, because legally I need the license and not all of us can learn English as fast or fluently as other people, very bad attention from the workers of the place with respect to people with language difficulties",1
"I went to Penndot on Lancaster ave. to update my driver's license to get the real ID, I showed them all the proper documentation, I showed them my birth certificate, my license, social security card and passport. I was told by one of the man on the window to come back after I got my passport just because my second last name wasn't on the social security card. But at the same time he also said that because my last name is long, the name might be abbreviated, which is also the same thing as not matching. He told me once I got my passport matching the birthday certificate, then I could come back to update for the real ID. I went back a second time and I was denied again. I checked the .gov website and the only thing that says is, If you have a changed of name, than you have to show documentation of the change name. My name is the same as my birth certificate, only the second last name is not there. And that's not something than changes your name. Specially when I already have a passport to prove my full name. I was denied by the manager that claimed it was on the website. The manager and the other man from the window should both get fired for not knowing how to do their job.",1

She then came in loud and clear on the intercom right next to my face, demanding I explain why my registration was expired. She was yelling. I even had to clarify that she was talking to me. This wasn’t just unprofessional, but extremely rude and honestly really frightening.

It was entirely inappropriate for this attendant to reprimand me when she should have been doing her job. A serious discussion about professionalism and appropriate demeanor with visitors would be helpful here.

It expired because I hadn’t renewed it yet. That was the point of going to the DMV… I won’t be headed to this location again.",1

"I went into this office this week and I have never seen such bad insensitive customer service.  There was a gentlemen asked about the fee's for electric car and and explanation of the taxes he was being charged.  The representative yelled at him ""you are making this more difficult"".  These are our tax dollars and we have the right to ask questions and have them explained to us.  I was have a car transferred to my name, I purchased this car at a very low rate because of mechanical issues and the gentlemen helping me understood this and needed another employee to sign off on the transfer and when she reviewed all my paperwork she scoffed at me and then angry typed something into the computer and issued my title.   This agency gets additional fees for collecting our tax dollars, yes our tax dollars which we as tax paying citizens have every right to question, we have every right to be treated as the customer as we are paying for a service and most of all we have the right to be treated with respect.  I will never go into this place again I will drive to 38th Street which is 15 miles from my home.  My suggestion is to management is  to remind your employees their job is customer service and if they do not like working in a customer service related field they should find a new job.  Customer service should not include scoffing, raising your voice, telling someone their questions are making it more difficult, watching the clock and rushing people and these are just a few tips.  I am extremely disappointed and will not be returning.  If you would like to reach out to me and discuss this matter please feel free to do so.",1

Today my husband came inside with me and the lady told us rudely that she could not do it. That my father in law needed to be there in person, then mumbled that he can send us a picture of his license,  then yelled next before I could ask her a question. I work in customer service and this lady should not be dealing with customers.

The lady who helped me was pleasant and made the whole ordeal very painless. Great customer service and friendly employees.",5

"I went here to improve on my driving for a ticket I received as a precaution before court. Scott was very communicative, honest and straight to the point. I learned so much more than I thought! It was a fun one on one class that didn’t feel like a class. He’s very knowledgeable and tells you like it is, which is what you need! Thank you!",5
"I went here to get temporary tags. As soon as I told the employee that I needed a replacement temp tag she started arguing with me about how I got the last temp tags. She never tried to help me in any way and then said that they could only take checks, nothing else, this was after acting like she couldn't get me temp tags anyway. Since I don't carry checks on me in 2021 I had to just leave.",1
"I went here to change my name. To get a same day appointment you have to get there very early. I got there at 7 and there were 30-40 people in front of me but once they opened they were able to get me my appointment time pretty quickly. They give you a slip of paper that has your appointment time on it. You come back at your appointment time and go right in, then they tell you where to go from there. Getting inside (getting an appointment) is quite a pain but once you are inside, it is pretty easy. The employees were not awful but they were definitely not pleasant either. Overall I was pleased because it wasn’t as bad as I remembered, but it wasn’t great. If the employees smiled or were friendly I would have given a higher rating. It is very very clean and they do a great job of maintaining social distancing, do a temperature screening when you enter and encourage masks.",3
I went here this past Tuesday for an appointment. This location is a bit out of the way for me but because of how kind and helpful everyone was this will now be the ONLY dmv I will be going to! I’m so happy to have found a location with such great workers!,5
I went here on Friday August 7.  I arrived a couple minutes before 2pm.. The line was wrapped around the building outside and some people had lawn chairs.....,5
"I went here for the tag and title paperwork and it was done quickly, easy process.",5
"I went here for my state ID (I do not drive). There is a lot of documentation that the state requires, and it can be confusing, so you do need to look online and make sure you bring more than you think you need. The website could be improved.
However, once I arrived, I was treated by everyone with courtesy and efficiency. Others seemed to similarly receive courteous service. One young man, who looked quite upset at not having a necessary document with him (it sounded like he had taken off time from his hourly wage job) was allowed to run home and get it. When he returned, he was promptly rushed through the line. I appreciated that.
They are also making sure everyone is appropriately distanced and safe. Thanks again.",5
"I went here for a photo. The woman who took my picture was great. She was friendly, professional and sociable. There was no wait time at all. When it is time for me to renew my license instead of going to the crowded dmv holding a ticket and waiting for ever, I get a camera card and come here. It is well worth it. I am always in and out.",5
I went here after moving to Louisiana from out of State to have my car registered.  They collected all my paperwork and then told me the price was going to be $2200 BUT I needed cash for anything over $600. I ended up leaving thankfully without registering my car here and made an appointment at the DMV the DMV used all the same paperwork that the woman had stapled together for me from Auto title express and told me I owed $1300. This sounds like complete robbery to me from auto title express. Might I add I was in and out in 5 minutes at DMV I waited at auto title express with an appointment for over an hour! Don't waste your money at this place there's some sort of money scam going on here.,1

I went for my NJ ID which was fine took few minutes but I wanted to take a driving written test and even though there is no way I can get an appointment online the person still told me to go online and apply. I went home in hope that there will be some slots but 0 appointments available. This is now two months and they still don’t have any appointments. I am very disappointed that I moved to NJ. I love the area but the transportation is very hard for me. I have to be able to get a car but without a license I can’t. The place is an hour away from me and I am sure when I do they will give same direction. I am not happy with this. Please help if anyone knows any direction. Thank you!,2

I went 3 times this week to get my 17 year old son state ID and nothing. After standing in line in fridged temperatures for over 2 1/2 hours each day 3 days in a row is inhumane. Something has to be done to fix the process of getting just a simple State ID! I honestly rate this place a -5!,1

"I wasn't familiar with this location so I looked up the address.  Good thing I read reviews (Google & Yelp) because DMV is located INSIDE Mall 205.  I would have been looking for a brick and mortar location.  The review I read said signage was not good however DMV signage was clearly marked outside and clearly marked telling where to go as you get up to the sidewalk. It's across from Famous Footwear but don't think  (as I did) that you can cut through because Famous Footwear has their gate down inside the mall.  Most likely to keep people from cutting through.  Overall this was a good experience.  They had 2 lines, 1 for appointments and 1 for walk-ins (stand by).  I had an appointment and was in and out in less than 1/2 hour.  Stand by line was moving quickly as well.",5

"I wasn't able to make an appointment online but the process was still easy. There's a kiosk to check in. It gives approximate wait times and puts your name in the queue on the TV up front. They also text when they're ready for you, in case you want to wait outside or go to another store in the strip mall. The best part is that they triage based on the service you're seeking. I left the Affton office when I saw the line was 20 deep and first come first served. It was worth the 15 minute drive to Maplewood because they were done updating my license within 10 minutes of my arrival.",5

"I was very misinformed about licensing which led to a waist of my day and valuable time. the website is very vague on issuing license. It DOES NOT clearly state where to go for testing, reissuing, documents to bring with you, etc. And having to drive all the way out there to only be turned away is not a good look for this state. Maybe I should've stayed in Tx.! Bad experience. Was not at all productive or helpful.",1

First I like their online booking system, some agency need to go there early morning 5:00am to get in the line for the limited 10-20people.

"I was very disappointed by the way I was treated at this location today. I arrived at closing which I understand is not ideal. After entering the building with my spouse,  I decided to wait in the car and headed to the door to exit. The young woman who was working said “We are closed and I can’t have you coming in and out, so are you going to stay out now?”  I should not have to say that this is rude and condescending. May I recommend this wording instead “ Ma’am, unfortunately we are now closed, so I will not be able to let you back in. Have a nice day.”

At that point, I can make an educated decision about whether I want to exit the building or not. I am startled and dismayed by a lack of common courtesy.",1

Instead I got the complete opposite! Hannah was super welcoming and had the best hospitality. She was able to get me in and out in ten minutes and was extremely kind and warm the entire time. She even ensured I was okay with my picture before proceeding. I’ve never had that before. While I was waiting another party came in (closer to 5min before closing now) and had an extremely difficult transfer with documents that needed extra review. Hannah and her peer (Don might’ve been his name) didn’t bat an eye to help them out! I can’t say enough about how taken back I was that an MVD was not only timely, but kind as well! They also kept a very clean shop that smelt like heaven when walking in. Way to go guys!",5

I was told I had to wait in the Reinstatement line to get the IL restriction removed from my license.  After 2 hours I was informed by the Woman who does Reinstatements that I could have just got in the renewal line and get a duplicate license without the restriction. The state has already removed it.  The Woman who does Reinstatements is one of the most unpleasant people I have ever had the misfortune to deal with. Anyone in the office that day world agree including the other staff members as they were commenting about her behavior as well.,1

He went to the back and asked a young lady sitting at a desk. She was explaining to him the problem with the title. He walks towards us and explains to us why we can not register the vehicle. As he was talking to us the young lady sitting in the back comes over cuts him off and begins to explain to us in a rudely manner then waves her hand as shes walking away saying that's not even valid. I don't know what her problem was but she was very rude. No hello, cuts the guy off while hes explaining and walks away even more rudely . Not once did she even raise her head to look at us. Very UNPROFESSIONAL!!!!!!!! We understood why we couldn't register the vehicle there was no argument there. It was her rudeness that blew me off!",1

Everybody working today was overall pleasant, I didn’t experience any rudeness which is rare for the DMV. I was there to get a new ID. First they took my picture and then I had to wait like 30 minutes or so to go over the info I needed updated on my ID (last name, address). It all went very smoothly and it was an easy process. This DMV isn’t bad at all! Just make sure to make an appointment and have all your documents with you and you’ll be fine!",5

Surprisingly, people were showing up without an appointment, and they were turned away. Additionally, if you need to complete more than 3 transactions (more than 3 vehicles), you need to make an additional appointment for those vehicles--you can make them for the same day--I heard a staff member telling someone this info. So, make your appointment online, have all your documents, be on time,  wear a mask, and you'll be in and out in no time. It's practically painless.",5

She explained the process to me, she told me what I would need to do and I left confident that I could take care of the issue.",5

I was just there. They are breaking federal law and fire codes. They let a certain amount of people in and literally lock the doors behind them. I told the employee that is illegal and he didnt care. He stated the manager said to do so. I called to speak with the manager and the manager would not speak to me. I can't  wait to inform the Fire Marshall Monday.,1

I was just recently in there today and I knew it was after 3:00 I've been here four times to try to make it before 3:00 to title transfer a car. I was asking the receptionist who I've seen here before to explain that I've been there four times and what would be my other option so before I could finish she interrupted me to tell me I had to be there before 3:00 which this I already knew because it was my fourth attempt. She then told me to calm down and to get a grip basically I found that very rude of her I did not interrupt her she interrupted me and then blamed me for my attitude. It's all stressful I get it but I'm not your problem,1

"I was headed here in order to get my out of state car inspected prior to getting it registered here in Kansas. It was a little hard to find as the pictures previously posted don't show what it looks like so I added a few. I would recommend calling ahead of time while they are open to make sure you have what you need. If you do not have the title in hand (lienholder has it), then you must have the bank fax it to them. Make sure they have it and that they have it stamped with inspection offices stamp. They forgot to stamp mine and just about turned me away but I was able to talk to them and showed that I had picked it up from them so they let me do an inspection.

Basically you walk in, make sure they have your title, then they'll tell you to pull up around back. I waited about 15 minutes before my inspection started. Then they have you pull in the garage and pop your hood. Then inspection took about 10 min.

I went on a Monday in the middle of the month (Dec) and arrived at 745 about 15 min after they open. I'm sure if I had arrived sooner my wait would have been less.

I understand there is a lot in the communication between dealership and licensing agency, and I have had some good experiences before with my tabs. I know they are nice people and this probably isn't the norm, but I think they should have checked it all before calling me down and having me wait around (twice).

I was actually only there for a hour which is the positive but I did not like certain employees treated people while I was waiting. They were rude to a few people and I definitely wouldn't have tolerated that if they had spoke to me like that. Glad to not have to go back,3
"I was actually at the MSP airport DVS but can’t find that on Google. What a team! They were so patient and kind, it was such an enjoyable experience. Those two deserve it all!!",5
"I was active duty in Norfolk from 13-14. Just got a letter being charged $287.89 from property taxes from a collections agency. I haven't lived in Norfolk since May 7th, 2014. These people gave no idea who to tax so they are trying to tax everyone.",1
I was able to take care of everything over the phone in a few minutes. Virtually no wait time when calling.  Everyone was friendly and helped me get my stuff straight.,5
"I was able to show my expired PA Driver's License and pay $50.50 to receive my photo card for a new PA Driver's License to be issued at the DMV. It's $30.50 for the photo card (same fee at the DMV), and a $20.00 service fee that Sue's Notary charges. If you are unable to utilize the online renewal process for your PA Driver's License, Sue's Notary is your best alternative option. It only took ten minutes to process my renewal - I just had to provide my new address and they made a copy of my Driver's License. They printed out my photo card, handed me a receipt for my order, and I was on my way. There was no waiting line either, I was called right back to the counter. Very professional and courteous staff, speedy service, and a nominal service fee. 5 stars! 🥳😁",5
"I was able to schedule an appointment the very same day. However, there was still a long wait, but it wasn't too bad. They do take walk-ins in the morning.
The staff was really helpful, patient and friendly. They will print out any document you need if you emailed it to them. I really appreciate Dorothy for helping me out and working with me.",5
I was able to go online book my appointment for the same day and was only there 2 hours for my passenger and school bus endorsement 😘🤗🥳,5
I was able to get to my appointment at two pm the line moved very quickly.  Barely anyone there.  Turned plates in.  Got a missing titled reprinted for 20 dollars.   Guy at window 4 had a great personality and was easy to deal with.  I have no idea why people drive out to the burbs to go to the dmv.,5

But I am grateful because my Pharmacy would not give me my Medicine without an ID, go figure.  Everything went smoothly even with the Computers going down for a little while, still better time than ever before being here in the past. Everyone was great and cheerful, very helpful. I was in and out within an hour. Have a great day.",4
"I was able to change my address here, which I was unable to do online because of nys.gov nonsense. However, I was not able to renew my license here but was able to do so online.

So pretty much what you probably expect from something with a DMV label on it.

Three stars because at least it has hours a person with a day job can get to.",3
I was a walk in and still did not have to wait very long. The lady with Driver's Solutions was extremely nice and very helpful. She helped me way beyond a 5 star rating.,5
I was a little set back going there after reading the reviews but my experience was wonderful. I didn't have hard copies of my insurance and they gave the fax number with what they needed on a piece of paper called my insurance and they sent it right over I was in and out in less than 20 min people were polite if you were polite back,5

"I wanted to write a review on your city hall or courthouse. I am not from the area. However, I think I wrote a review a year ago but you erase it. Shame on you if you did. I am here to say i hope changes were made. I was so mad to see the behavior the City manager made. His name is David. However, he harass and threaten a wonderful person. This guy just filming the city hall. The city manager just walked to him and kept harassing him for ten minutes. I hope he is gone now and away from the public. He is a danger to the public and a dangerous man. He can lose his angry anytime. Please do something and he is a waste to the city in my eyes. I am concerned citizen worry about the public rights and well being oppressed by corruption.",1
"I wanted to transfer my current tag to a new vehicle, but the lady who serviced me made me a new tag instead without warning me which was obviously more expensive. They are very quick if you have an appointment.",2
"I wanted to say something positive since there is such a negative reputation given to the DMV.  I had a very unique issue with my plate renewal. Katrina, Diane and Shirley were so helpful in resolving this for me. It took two visits but they were so polite, positive and thorough. My issue was finally solved to my satisfaction and we all learned something new about the mail in process.
I highly recommend going in person to the New Bern location if you want to make ANY changes to your plate/registration.  It’s much easier and less messy than renewing and making changes on-line or in the mail.",5
"I wanted to leave an account of my experience in case it's helpful to anyone. I arrived at 7:10 a.m. without an appointment (Google says this location opens at 8, but it is in fact 7.) There were 2 lines outside: one for people with appointments, and one for people without. There were 4-5 people ahead of me in line. I was called inside after about 20 minutes. Inside, I waited about 40 minutes to be seen. I was there for a last name change and provided my current license, new social security card, and marriage certificate. They did not need form DL-101, Affidavit for a Name Change, even though the website said it's required. They did ask if I had my birth certificate or passport (I didn't bring either), but I realized later that might have been just to see if I could get a Real ID. They took my picture, I paid something like $14, and I received a temporary license right then. Everyone I dealt with was professional and polite. I was back in my car by 8:30 a.m. My recommendation is to make an appointment for first thing in the morning if possible, arrive at least 10 minutes early, and verify ahead of time what documents you need by calling the office. Based on the reviews, I was prepared for a nightmare morning, but it went a lot better than I expected.",4

I want a job for the DOT. Put a sign with little orange flags to change lane information but don't change the old signs. It's OK because public safety doesn't matter. A half @$$ job is acceptable for government workers. Over paid if you ask me. If I did my job like they can I'd be fired. Time for change and hold our government departments and workers to the same standards the general public is. I called to report this. Told he's in and available and I get a voice mail. Probably planning another half @$$ project with our tax dollars. Do your jobs and do it right. Public Safety matters to the public.,1

I have applied quite a few times to work in this office — with NO luck — they could REALLY use me on this office, I think........",1
I tried calling for days but today I finally got a answer the lady was very rude and when she asked what’s my account number I told her give me one second so I can pull it up and she just hung up I called back 10 times and no answer just terrible customer service,1
"I transferred a title for a travel trailer I just purchased at the Clerk's office today.  Be prepared to stand outside for a long while, and please read the list of acceptable identifications they will accept.  I had to go home to get a water bill and return, because my driver's license alone wouldn't suffice.  All together, with the 20 minute trip home and back, it took 2 hours.  Lot's of standing.

"I took my road test today. Everything went well, the woman who took my test wasn't rude or inappropriate. The test lasted 3-5 mins for me. She did everything, including parallel parking and a 3 point turn. I did everything right and I was confident I passed. When the test was over, she told me to check my results online. I checked and she failed me. She took off points on everything, she might as well have put the entire checklist on the score sheet. She even claimed that she had to pull the brakes, but how can she pull the brakes when it was a private car? She did not have her own set of brakes. She stated I was on the wrong side of the road but honestly  I don't even know what that means. I had read reviews on this place before the test and I didn't believe what people wrote but in all honesty, don't take the test at Maspeth. The woman I got failed me for no reason. Either she made a mistake with the scores or she purposely failed me for no reason. She's a bad instructor.",1

Her whole energy and aura was calming and definitely took away some of the nerves I had. Made me more relaxed during my drive test. I think she said she teaches at a driving school? Either way, 5 stars!!  She’s amazing!",5

After my information was put into the computer I attempted to shake my instructors hand and thank him for everything, he ignored me and he refused to shake my hand. My experience here was disappointing due to the lack of professionalism.",1

The nurse helped us to figure out where and how we could request records from another state. She did not want to traumatize him with unnecessary vaccines (neither did i)  I wasn't expecting she would get them quickly, or have the time to call to let me know any time soon.
She called me back 3 days later, the same morning she got the email.
The people at the clinic work very hard and have to deal with so much.Staff there could easily work at a nice private practice clinic with half the workload and half the stress . I'm sorry someone posted the front office people are rude They are trying to get hundreds of people seen a day,  without enough providers (made much worse by covid I'm sure)..
I am so grateful for the service they provide , professionalism and kindness showed to us. They are angels!",5
"I took my 18 year old daughters  there to take their road test 2 weeks ago. Although we had to wait over an hour to get in,, the ladies that we dealt with inside were all friendly and kind. My girls each had a different instructor for their test. The first one was very nice and comforting to my daughter; really made her feel at ease. She passed. Unfortunately,  the second one was absolutely horrible! She tried to intimidate my daughter by talking down to her, constantly rolling her eyes, and actually told her the wrong thing to do at one point as if trying to mess her up. Needless to say, she failed her. My daughter has been driving and practicing for a year. She is an extremely good and careful driver. Definitely, do not go to Leeds Ave for your road test and if you do,  pray you get the instructor whose name is Tracy,  the good one!",2

I swear this place must be full of inept employees.  Two hour wait thus far for vehicle registration.  These people are moving as slow as molasses. No need to move faster … jobs for life!!!,1
I suppose we all dread going to the “Tax Office” - but….These folks run a smooth operation.   I had purchased a vehicle out of state and needed to handle the licensing in person.  I actually had to go back a second time - it was my mistake in that I needed my lovely wife’s signature on a document.  Two different people helped me & both were knowledgeable & kind.  Thank you for the very good service.,5
I stopped to pickup my title for my new car and they said they didn’t have it- it was listed on the bmv website as available for pickup. Went to Medina and no problems. Don’t waste your time at this one. Worker said she was there for 30 years to justify turning me away and I was able to go get it somewhere else with no issues.,1
I stopped in to see if I could take my written driving test. I was told by the man lounging behind the counter that they took walk ins if they weren't busy during the hours of 8-11. It was before 11. 1 person was in the room when I got there and then he left. He refused to let me take my test. I'm a 40 year old mom with epilepsy whose seizures are totally under control but due to some paperwork issues my license was completely cancelled. I'm trying to do the right thing instead of driving around without a license. Quit eating Twinkies and do your job!!!! Zero stars!!,1

I sold my car to my mom. We had all the paperwork filled out. They made her go back 4 separate times because they kept nit-picking finding little things they needed me to write statements about. We are both nurses and I work night shift. She had to keep coming back and waking me up just to write out these statements so they would process the registration. Absolutely the worst! How about you guys get your act together and actually tell us everything you need us to fix the first time?! Worst customer service ever. Absolute worst.,1
I sold my car to my daughter who moved out of state and immediately transferred the insurance to her policy. I've mailed the NC plate back months ago and am still getting letters with fees and collection threats. I've tried to call numerous times and can't get through to anyone. Just when I think I've finally gotten to the place where a real person will talk to me the line goes silent. I'm tired of paying fees for lapse in liability when the car has been covered with no lapse in coverage. I mailed a letter with proof that my plate had been received at their office and two weeks later I get another letter asking for another $110. I'm so frustrated!,1

I did overhear a friendly employee at a nearby station, so not everyone was unfriendly. Overall an average experience, but I didn’t really expect more from a license office. Would recommend for efficiency as long as you go in with everything you need and the expectation that you likely won’t get good customer service.",3

My insurance company has created an issue that has cost me time, money and now (possibly) a clean insurance history... but the staff here- Dawn in particular- has made EVERY human effort to help.

The issue is still unresolved, since September, but the experience has been a matter class in customer service... thanks in no small part, to Dawn.",5

"I scheduled a 9:30am appointment to get my Real ID/Driver's license and I also needed to register my car and get license plates (the new to NC inauguration).

I arrived 15 mins early and stood in line behind the blue tape. Written in faded chalk on the sidewalk is written which line is which. Make sure you are in the correct line at all times so you don't waste your time! Also be sure to wear a mask or you will not be serviced here.

I got inside to the driver's license line by my appointment time but then there were 20 people ahead of me to get to an actual clerk. The intake lady was nice to some people and less nice to others.

It took about 90 minutes before my number was called so I had time to study for the traffic sign test.

My number was finally called and it took about 10 minutes to get processed for my license.

This location happens to have the vehicle registration and license/tag offices in the same building!! So I hopped into the next line where I waited for about an hour to get my vehicle registered and a license plate.

$500 and three hours later, I was on my way home.

I recommend making an appointment online, but if you want to do a walk-in, get there at 6:30 am so you are first in line. Otherwise you'll be standing outside in the hot sun waiting for your turn to get in. Be sure to look at the website and bring all the correct forms and documents printed out.

If you do have an appointment they do take those people first.,4

Now, the information regarding the vehicle is common sense but the title/document number and the date of issue is what might be a problem in the future, if ever needed. Unfortunately the number could not be provided over the phone, which would of saved me time, so in 30 days I will need to go in to receive another title. It's frustrating to see that an establishment that follows strict guidelines from those entering would allow a legal document to leave it's offices looking like this. Unless a machine is doing the work, a quick overview would or should have determined that the quality does not meet standard or expectations for something so important.",1
"I received a letter from the Treasurer's Office for a Property Tax Bill that it purports I incurred for my vehicle in 2015. I was Active Duty US Navy from 2011 to late 2016, and lived in Virginia, not claiming residency, from 2011 to May 2014, not a single day in 2015 or since. I spoke to the Commissioners office representatives who insisted that regardless of this and a myriad of evidence I provided, I would still need to send an LES and expose more of my personal data and incur further hardship, since the process for requesting old LES's is lengthy and the time constraint of tax season would have caused me further problems with my current state if my return was not disbursed to me. I was insistent and persistent and demanded, though respectfully, to speak with a Supervisor who could better resolve the issue.
To their credit, they finally were able to buck the policy and are in the process of removing the debt. The people I spoke to there were respectful, patient, and ultimately accommodating. Unfortunately, the tax policies, especially when related to veterans and active duty military COMMANDED to be there under ORDERS, can create hardship, undue strain, and completely disregard the needs of service men and women. Often, these service-members are fresh out of High School and do not know any better than to question or prod further. As a result, these tax and personal property policies can seem predatory when it is likely these young military members will end up paying taxes they are not supposed to be paying in the first place, meanwhile the local government makes some extra quick money. I work in Federal government still today, I know policy and I help write it often. Policy must not come at the cost of effective, efficient, and ethical service, most especially to those dedicating their lives to serve our country. Those of us in public service must not forget that we are where we are at the convenience and benefit of the PUBLIC, not the other way around. We must endeavor to enact policies and serve the public in a way that reflects that, always.",3

Matter of fact, everyone there was super friendly and nice to me.

Also, it's awesome that they swap out their days so they're closed on Monday but open on Saturdays for full hours.  For someone in healthcare who can't really take days off easily, this is a godsend.

Nothing could be further from the reality.   I was greeted at the door, and instructed who to see to facilitate my requirements.  I was immediately given the proper papers to fill out, and a number for my turn in line.  My number was called almost before I could finish filling in the designated sections of the form I was given.  The lady who processed my form was very courteous and competent and completed my processing very efficiently. I was able to use my bank card to pay the fee.   I was then instructed to proceed to the other side of the room to obtain my photo.  I thought this would be where I'd have to wait, and I girded myself for the ordeal.

I'm not sure if the staff at Troop K is new, but the people I dealt with, Sergeant Roy Fullerton, was as nice as they come. I was 30 minutes late to my appointment because I drove to the wrong place. I called Sergeant Fullerton to explain why I was late for appointment, and he was super understanding, gave me the correct address, and instead of making me reschedule he told me that he would still see me that day. When I finally arrived for meeting I was seen very quickly, and as I stated previously Sergeant Fullerton was a really friendly, funny, good guy. I can't speak to the character of anyone at DPS aside from Sergeant Fullerton. Personally I would call, and ask for Sergeant Fullerton directly if you need to have a vehicle inspected. Overall it was a great experience, and I regretted waiting so long to get vehicle inspected. Thanks to Sergeant Fullerton for his professionalism, & upbeat attitude it is very much appreciated.",5

While I was in line I was witness to some of the best de-escalating I have ever seen, not only once but TWO times I watched this man fend off excessively aggressive behavior by two different people. The guy should be a hostage negotiator. And the wonderful ladies who helped me, forgive me I can’t recall their names, were very thorough and patient during my  two trips, (my fault it took more then one visit) It’s amazing to me how great the people are in this office for how lousy they’re treated. Do better Sioux Cityans.",5

"I made an appointment for 11:45am today. I arrived around 11:35 and signed in on the iPad as directed. At 11:55 or so, the man next to me went to ask if it would be much longer of a wait, since he had signed in for his appointment at 11:30 but had not been called. I'm not sure how they responded, but he was called back within a few minutes.

I waited until around 12:25, watching multiple people get called ahead of me, and decided I'd ask how much longer it would be. At first, the person I spoke to thought I was just trying to cut in line but I explained that, like the guy earlier, I had an appointment and signed in but had waited almost an hour. They did not seem to believe me and kept stating that my name was nowhere in the system. I said that I did have an appointment and did sign in but that I would need to leave and make an appointment for another day because I had to go back to work. One person asked me to wait for a moment and then she called me back.

I believe the people working thought that I was lying and that I pretended to have the same issue as the guy before me. That was not the case. If more than one person states that they have the same issue, it may be worth checking the technology in use to make sure it's working properly instead of assuming that people are lying. But I get it, people suck and I'm sure they've had plenty of rude and entitled customers try to con their way ahead in the line.

The actual process of getting my address changed on my license was quick and painless; it was handled effectively. I would return here for similar services but would ask them to double-check that my sign-in had been accepted by the program so that this didn't happen again.

I would recommend that they check to make sure the sign-in system is working accurately. Also, for those of you who are immunocompromised or otherwise wanting to avoid crowds, they do require masks but the seats are as close together as they can get. Social distancing was definitely not in place and I felt really uncomfortable sitting so close to people.",3

"I like the city and everything but the rode to the city dump makes way to much noises like today. No notice for the people who live on the corner of coal mine RD. And Otis ST. People who works afternoons through to the nights and who works over nights. Did not have no notice of all of this notice. Some of us who can't afford any ac, fans, or portable cooling systems have to keep the windows open to get any relief from the hot weather. Because the Apartments does not have a/c within the units. The management has failed to report that the units does not have a/c and failed to report that there is a lot of noises that goes by the Apartments.
So on my behalf I'm just saying if there is any form of Construction happening in a residential area please give the people in the area at least one day ahead notice so they can do what is necessary to proceed with life. For an example plenty of rest or remove a vehicle before it's too late. If the worst case scenario a person loses their job and have a hard time to get another job ends up homeless and won't be able to pay taxes till they get back on their feet.
Sincerely a concerned citizen of Missoula Montana.

I know it's unusual for a DMV to get five stars but they deserve it!  They were quite busy today as it is the end of the month but still moved people through rather quickly. A gentleman was called up and immediately started firing off how he had been waiting for over an hour when the young lady who was helping him politely stated that he had only been in there for 20 minutes. He continued to be quite irritated and when he was told that he would need his wife there in order to use her card he immediately flipped out. All of the workers there where as colitis could be given the situation and I commend them for durability to hold out without being rude. Very friendly service! Thank you for what you guys do!,5

Helpful, answering my question, directing me to the right locations, proper paperwork. Helpful. The facility is great too. Lots of seating so your not standing forever. But it didn't take forever. I was in and out in about 30 min with a packed house. I was there for a title trans so other things may take longer but they have dedicated staff for each category of issues so you are not waiting for 3 dozen registrations before you get seen for something different. The only thing I would change is to add a little color or art to the walls. A bland grey room for any amount of time sucks. Overall very happy with the staff and the system they have. Enjoy",5

For example, going West on access between 281 and Stone Oak Pkwy and you take turnaround to go back east on access.  The yield is yheir. but when you turn your head to look for traffic you are looking through weeds.  Also shy did you ably do part of the interchange at 1604 and 281 about 5 to 7 years ago?  Now we have to put up with more work and delays. When you seek budget for a project seek to complete entire project.  Maybe another project waits until another completed.

I kinda like the system they are doing now with making an appointment.,5
"I just went to this DMV today to get my driver’s license and the teller (window 12 at 9:30 this morning) messed up my date of birth. She told me that I wrote it wrong on the form (it wasn’t) but she had 3 pieces of ID to double-check it against. She clearly didn’t make that check or even ask me which one was correct. She was completely incompetent. Other than that, the process was smooth.",3
I just went there and was 7 min EARLY and got turned away saying they aren’t doing anymore testing for day. When I asked why they we were early they just said because. It’s always the chunky officer in brown that’s rude the lady. Every single time. I left without an argument it’s not worth it but pls spare your time ppl and go somewhere else for the drive test portion,1
"I just want to say what a pleasant experience it was to be helped by Colton today!!! He was super friendly, helpful and knowledgeable with all the questions...",4
"I just want to say that my visit here was very pleasant. The lady at window 8 was so patient, professional, helpful, courteous, nice and went above and beyond to help me with what I came there for 🤗🤗🤗",5
I just want to say Thank You to the TDOT operator who took my call today. I had a screaming baby in my car that was on the side of the road on i40. I was panicked & she was so kind & patient. I missed her name because of baby screams & traffic speeding by but I just have to say thank you soooo much. TDOT thank you!!!!!,5
I just want to say thank you to Erilena so much for the absolute and attentive service . Not only was she helpful she was also very caring and professional. Very knowledgeable and knows what she is doing . I recommend anyone with questions to see her. It’s hard to find attentive service now a days . She was also very fast and helped me with everything I needed to do and answered all my questions . Big thanks to Erilena for helping me .,5
"I just walked into the Erie DMV and I've never had a good experience. But today I don't think I've had a better experience with a state agency in my life! Not only did they answer all of my questions, they were cheerful and respectful, and they definitely went above and beyond and everything that we discussed today. If I could give more than five stars I would!",5

Normally, experiences with...",5
"I just spoke to Ochoa on the phone. She was incredibly kind and helpful. I highly recommend working with her if you get the chance. 5 out of 5 service!

However, I have had quite a lot of trouble getting through to the social security office, hence my reduction of 5 stars to 4",4
I just set up my daughter's driver's exam and talked to the most helpful and friendly person. Thank you for the great service!,5
"I just recently moved to New Mexico so I was blown away by the amazing service Esmeralda gave me. Normally any trip to the DMV office is a teeth clenching, gut punching nightmare, but she was wonderful and made my experience outstanding. Thank you Esmeralda for the quick efficient service in getting my license taken care of and starting the process to get my vehicle registered as well.",5
I just recently moved from California to Bartlett Tennessee.  I needed to switch over my Driver's License had questions spoke with a very lovely nice lady Ms. Brenda Pittman.  Ms. Pittman (station #106) made it easy answered all my questions and set my appointment.  Days later went in meet her in person as well as another nice lady Ms. Valtina Hayes.  They both made my experience very pleasant and welcomed me to Tennessee!!,5
I just need to say that this place is awesome! Coming from California and seeing the difference in wait times was shocking enough. I had gone to the bmv in...,5
"I just moved to TN from SC, so I had to register my car here. I was in and out in less than 10 minutes. The process was very easy, and I walked out with my new license plate.",5
"I just moved to Lexington from Columbia, so I went in this morning to change the address. I was in and out within a half hour all the paperwork filled out, my picture taken for my new license. This is a very efficient office, they get you in and out and all the workers here we're all working to make this a better experience for Lexington South Carolina residences!",5
"I just moved here from California. I have lived in 4 other states. This is the most ridiculous, backwards, inefficient process I have ever experienced. Because I need a Real ID in addition to transferring to Oklahoma from California, (and already having a Real ID in CA), I have no way to speak to a live person to get some direction about reserving an appointment. Unbelievable. I have called all the numbers listed and checked the websites. Because I am transferring from another state, I have to appear in person. Yet, the “new and improved website” is absolutely useless for my situation. This is the worst! Apparently I can walk in at the mega center but because of my status I need an appointment. Stupidity.",1

"I just can’t say enough about this location on  the 4000 block of Menaul. I have gone to this location for years. Always pleasant and great service. I was there on Tuesday and again on Wednesday. Both times all of your employees were pleasant, very helpful and just a pleasure to deal with. Makes me want to go back and I will continue to do so. I hope all managers are aware of these positive posts. Thank you again.",5

I just called and asked like 7 question. The woman 9n the phone was professional and very patient and knowlegable.  I appreciated her answering everything I needed answered.,5
"I immediately got called once i walked through the door and the lady that attended me was very polite and helpful with my vehicle registration along with another that attended me last year as well! But the one who got one my nerves was the lady attends you at the ""Wait Here""t sign ,when I gave her my information she had an attitude and the  multiple times I've been there in the past she always has an attitude, you'll know who I'm talking about if you ever go there for vehicle registration.",4
I hope this place never see me again. There customer service is garbage and whoever the lady was that was helping me she was snatching stuff out of my hand and I go by my name not buddy and if you forgot my name then look on my driver license.,1
I hired Castro Roofing to make some repairs to my roof and replace the flashing around my chimney. I was very impressed with the quality of the work that was done.,5
"I highly recommend this office. The staff is always friendly and helpful, and it's never very crowded.",5
I highly recommend this office! They are so nice and quick I waited maybe 10 minutes and it was so easy! They are very clean an have plenty of space and seats to wait. I believe I saw a ramp for wheelchair/walker accessibility. You must wait for someone to press the button to open the door for you so be patient and listen for the clicks of the door being unlocked. They have someone waiting on the inside of the door to check you in for your appointment or check you in as a walk-in. Will be back here for any future needs.,5

I highly recommend desert title. I've been going there for years. Always in and out quick. People are very helpful and friendly.,5
I heard some pretty bad reviews about this place but my experience was very positive. The staff was friendly and helpful and we were finished quickly. I would recommend sending all of your documents in for review and scheduling an appointment on line. It made the process much easier.,5
I haven't visited a bmv,1

Be glad you have people who want to make things easier on you in the long run. Made an appointment... In and out in about 30 minutes. Got my daughter her permit and I am super happy",5

I haven't experienced a lot of really long wait times. As long as you have all your paper work it should go smoothly. Not every person that work there is nice so try to be as calm as you can.,4
"I haven’t stepped foot into a license plate office for years because online is so easy. This year was more complicated so I came into the office. I cannot impress on you how quickly, efficiently, and safely I got through the line. Amazing place, friendly staff, and safety conscious!",5

"I have yet to have a bad experience. Today alone was a great example. I’d lost my license and was more than willing to wait for an opening to get it replaced. When the gal saw some appointments open up, she got me in the earliest and I was done before the appointment time! Such nice people, not the stereotypical DOT experience!",5

"I have used this service 7 times already. I buy and sell many cars throughout the year as a hobby and have use other services. I can honestly say Brian, the owner, has provided the best customer service out of any company here in Las Vegas. I recommend him to all my friends and everyone has the same experience. He works incredibly fast. It is worth every penny to not have to wait in line for eight hours or have to wait two months for an appointment. He usually has documents and new plates back to me within 48 hours.

Very happy and will continue to use his services.",5

"I have tried to reach a person that would tell me or connect me with a person that would help me order 5 county road maps. I was connected with one menu after another which did not offer a choice which would help me and when I did reach a person they would switch my call to dept.'s that were of no help or people that would disconnect me or switch me to automated systems that requested my name, phone number, etc. I left the info. twice. Never received a return call! No one is interested in helping with such a simple request. I am frustrated and have a VERY bad impression of the DOT personel! I have called 5 of their listed phone numbers with no success - no one will help!!! What am I to do??",1

I have tried to call them for two days now and I have not gotten an answer. Very disappointed.,1
I have tried calling this place since the middle of January.  All I get is a recording telling me to leave my name and number and I will get a callback. I've never got a callback and this is August. When I'm at work I have to do my job. My tax dollars are paying their wages. You're fired!,1

"I have to say the appointment option works very well. Smiling faces to greet you and knowledgeable folks..
However the only drawback is the parking lot in the Springfield office, Queens. You get there a little early but then your almost late or late due to one thing.. The fact that they automated the lot is great! The fact that they only have ONE PAYMENT MACHINE sucks. Now your waiting on a line to pay for your car before you go in. It's a friendly machine to the young but I experienced a few older folks having a real hard time with it. Small buttons and  the sun was right on the machine making it hard to see.
The digital divide is a real thing. Catering to all should include a helpful person and another machine on this site..Looking forward to the next visit soon to see if they make corrections for the better.",3
"I have to say that it's way better than the California DMV. My wife and I needed to get our cars registered and we needed to get our Nevada drivers licenses. Everyone was so nice and friendly. It was a very smooth process for us. And, they have a nice snack bar inside. How awesome is that?",5

"I have to say it was a frustrating time. I got there at 7am, they don't open till 8am. There are people on the line selling there spot on The line and selling there tickets, also people just skipping the line. It's really not fair after waiting 2 hours, people just come out of no where and get on line and they give them a ticket like they were there the whole time. The line was already a full block away, and starting to go around the corner when I got there. When they opened the doors they began giving out numbered tickets,  after you have your ticket you still need to wait on line. Once I had my ticket it took a hour to get to the front door. Once I was inside, I was done in no time. Less then 30 min. But all I did was get registration renewal.  If your getting a new registration it may take an additional 45 min. In that case once you go in they take your cell number and then text you when to come back to pick up your plates. Takes about 45 min. I was there a total 3 hours. Everyone that works there were very polite and helpful.",4

When I got to the door… in less than 15 minutes, a very nice security guard handed me a number and asked that I return at 11.  A little inconvenient… but ok.

I returned at 11.  Was immediately ushered into line.  I waited in line 10 minutes before I was called to do my business.  All in all, pretty painless.  A great improvement over the old location.",5

I’m an adult with a full time job so that wasn’t really an option. Luckily a Saint found my wallet and I was able to get everything squared away. Anyway, Jackie and the whole staff was absolutely amazing, gracious and helpful. I can’t say enough amazing things about Jackie personally though. She’s a queen! Thank you all so much!",5
I have passed by this place numerous times in the past. Stopping in today I learned they charge a 70 dollar fee on top of the registration for your vehicle.  My only issue is getting it done quick fast and a hurry but looking at their past reviews they are not to be trusted further than u can throw them.  On a nicer note the female I got the quick info from was sweet while offering her bit of knowledge. So if u want to take a gamble go try this place out but I think they should be more trustworthy to charge that kind of fee. I rather just schedule me an appointment with the classic DMV office...,3

I have only been living in the area a few months. So I need to renew everything liscenses registrations ext. First I called hawkins county should have known better. I didn't get a human for almost an hour then they told me this long drawn out details for getting my address switches. It was awful and nasty. When I called Knox county had my answers in a minute and I only needed one piece of paper Info not a days worth of work. Thankyou,5
I have nothing but great things to say about the folks that work here. Great bunch of people. Professional and very helpful. Keep up the great work everybody.,5

You made the process very easy today.",5
"I have not received my tag renewal to date due to USPS mail slow down. I called Hoover Tag Department earlier today and was advised by an official working their to provide my tag number or vin over the phone to obtain fees for my tags. I was driving at the given time and was unable to provide the necessary information at the time. I called back at approximately 4:00 pm, on 10/6 and was told by a lady name Mrs. Ruffin my request can't be accommodated despite a government mail slow down and I would have to appear at Probate to get information. I requested a supervisor and Ms. Ruffin advise she was the supervisor. I instructed Ms. Ruffin to place her supervisor on the phone. Mr. McGee answered the phone stating his rank is the highest supervisor after I asked numerous time his exact title. (It went unanswered). Both were to lazy to serve the citizens of this county. Needless to say! I called another probate and obtain the information. Both Ruffin & McGee don't deserve the privilage to serve Jefferson County residents.

I have no other way I can find to contact anyone from the DEM. First. I would give the DEM a 5. R.I . Is fantastic to the angler.  We have places to park and great boat launches.  Free.  Unlike Massachusetts.  My complaint is. Why we as anglers do not have access to one of the best bass fishing lakes in Rhode Island and Massachusetts. Massachusetts has a boat launch. To a lake we share. And I believe we stock with trout and salmon. With our licensing fees. Yet to Launch a boat or kayak from the Massachusetts side charge their residence nine dollars and Rhode Island residence $30 to park why doesn’t Rhode Island give road  island residence access to this fantastic lake ?  You have property bordering the lake Buckhill management area why should I pay Massachusetts $30 to park and launch my kayak? Rhode Island DEM please give us access to this fantastic lake and shut down Massachusetts extortion ring,3
I have no idea why this office has such bad reviews. In my 36 years of dealing with the dmv I’ve never had such a pleasant experience and witnessed the same for others. One older asian woman came in who seemed to struggle with english and brought her best friend to help. Protocol doesnt allow it right now and one employee told her “Im you’re  best friend today”and walked her through the process. We waited 45 minutes only to find out my 83 year old dad still needed a birth certificate because of federal requirements. They apologized and told us to go get it and come back. When we got back the same person that first helped us before was surprised to see us again and sat us down and we were next. We interacted with at least 5 different people and they were all so nice and helpful. This place should a minimum of 4 stars. Breaks my heart such nice and helpful people would get such bad reviews.,5

"I have never had any issues at this location. The employees are always quick and efficient. They open at 7am, and I arrived at 6:15am this morning. Two ladies were already standing outside the door, so I decided to follow suit. A few minutes passed and a gentleman came up and stood in the line. Needless to say, by 6:45 there were about 30 people in the line.
When the doors opened at 7am, an employee came out and told everyone to have their documentation and paperwork ready, she also gave a list of criteria of said documentation for all of the services. She also expressed that they are still practicing social distancing and masks are required.
I was 3rd in line and my renewal along with updating my address took me all of 2 minutes.
My advice is:  get there early if you can and have the correct documents.
Their process runs smooth, so even if you do have to stand in line it won’t be for too long. Besides, they only allow you in the building after you’ve shown them that you have the proper items at the door.",5

"I have never driven in my life.  For me, driving was a lot of anxiety, accelerating fear, and images of pedestrians popping out in my head, and even the tragic sight of a car accident came to my mind every time I sat in the car.  However, this school taught me the knowledge I needed and the dangers of driving for a whole day.  Three weeks later, six hours of driving practice began.  I was in charge of a gentle gentleman and easygoing man named Jake.  I was worried because I was a beginner in driving and I was not good at English, but that worry soon disappeared.  I asked him immediately if he had any questions, and he immediately gave me the best answer.  After 6 hours of driving practice, many of my anxieties and fears of driving were largely gone.  I was lucky to learn to drive from him.  I strongly recommend this school to everyone.",5

"I have never been treated so rudely and unprofessional in my life. The behavior of the young ladies that work in there was absolutely appalling. We have always lived in Walker County until recently and I have never dealt with such cruel and incompetent staff before. I will not use this particular office again nor do I recommend.

There wasn't a wait, I didn't have to ask any questions due to being given all pertinent information first hand, I felt like they were waiting for me to arrive as if I had an appointment. By far this is the best customer service you'll ever come by. I recommend Hill-top Tag & Title to everyone, I mean EVERYONE I know !!! Thank you !!!!",5

I have macular degeneration and can not drive anymore and I walk with a walker. Needless to say I was at the DMV in Bridgeport Ohio to surrender my license and get an ID.  Those ladies that work there are the nicest women I have seen in one place for a long time.  Angela registered me in and she is just delightful.  She was so kind to me.

I have had to go 3 different days to get my license because Im told different stuff from the employees. First I was told I only needed a passport to get the real ID so when I reschedule Im told I need my SSC too. My current Colorado Drivers license is already a real ID which I couldn’t have gotten without the documents they need in the first place. I come back again with all my documents and now Im told I need to take a 2 hour class at home and come back to take a test which I do but when Im asked for my two proofs of residency I tell them I can only email it which the lady I was with previously said I could do and even emailed it to herself. Its a waste of time to have to come back and take hours away from work to do this. Now I have to come back a 4th time which is more of a waste of time.,1
"I have had nothing but TERRIBLE customer service here. Timothy Doyle as well as Larry Curtis do NOT deserve a job here. They are rude and don’t reply to emails, let alone do their job!",1
I have had great experiences the two times I have went to this MVD. But my most recent was phenomenal. Star helped me and I am so glad she did. She is very informative. She made sure she took me step by step through everything she did. I had another thing that I needed to get done in the future and she kept that in mind and told me of the things I needed for that as she was completing the task at hand. Multitasking at its finest. She was very friendly and made me feel like I was talking to a friend😊 Thank you to this MVD staff and Thank You Star. I will definitely be back to this MVD and will totally recommend this MVD 🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟,5
"I have had extremely rude service from one particular lady that is working there. I have family who have served in the past, and currently serving our country in the military. She is treating our veterans with complete disrespect. In one situation, she had to mutter to herself over and over ‘don’t get mad’ after a request by my son for a military tag. Another,  tried to refuse another veteran a tag simply because she didn’t want to look up the information to order the tag. This place needs an overhaul! It’s frustrating that the public has to DREAD dealing these people!",1

Then I gave her another name with 8 letters and digits she said it must be 7 letters at most. I said but, I'm seeing the space for 9 letters she raised her voice like an angry mom over her kid and said you can see here is written only 7, in a loud voice. My only crime was I had no idea somewhere is written no more than 7 letters meanwhile I was seeing the space for 9 letters on the form. Then, I kind of felt she was trying to be nice due to feeling that she raised her voice quite excessively and rudely. But, I had several questions even, I didn't have any desire to even ask her about them. I just left there speechlessly! I know that's not end of the world.

Now i’m taking this up with the municipal court. This place needs a either a new system or to be taking down. I don’t need to pay taxes to pay more for faux tickets to waste time in a court.",1

For the in-person drive lessons, some of my teachers were a bit more difficult to work with than others, but overall, I had a B+ good experience (shoutout to James Charvet and Jim Freaney for being some of my favorite instructors!). I think all of the teachers well qualified and experienced, and I learned a lot from them. I think one of the things that I have appreciated the most about DDS is their customer service. Especially since the pandemic, the customer question email has been SUPER helpful and they will always provide thorough answers quickly. This has been such a life-saver as it has helped ease a lot of my anxieties and concerns. Thanks so much for the great experience!!",5

I had an appointment to get my drivers license renewed since I just turned 21. I went to check in and the lady that was working the desk was extremely rude and very short with me. She was frustrated because my data was taking a second to load my proof of address so I could get it emailed to them. I work in customer service and I get that it’s probably very frustrating having to wait 5 seconds for something to load on a customer’s phone but her attitude was uncalled for. Felt like a burden. I apologized at least twice and she did not respond or even acknowledge that I was speaking either time.,1
I had an appointment this morning to register an older truck that I've bought. I had the title and I was told that I needed a letter from the Institution that was listed on the title. I had a signature on the title from the Institution. It was a private person from whom I purchased truck. Mind you it is a 2002 truck. I certainly would not have the title if there was still any money owed. Needless to say that I wasn't able to register my truck. So annoying.,1
"I had an appointment scheduled for 9:20. Had to line up as the rest of the non-appointment folks and the clerk was not able to explain the benefit of scheduling an appointment vs. not, offhandedly remarked the appointment gets you processed faster but I had to get to the back of the line as the rest. Interestingly, there's a large red sign on the other side of the counter that reads, Appointment Check-in here"" but nobody was at the counter. When I eventually got through the line to the counter, the same clerk asked me if I wanted a Real ID. Admittedly, I should have looked that up as I had no idea what she was talking about. Obviously, I didn't bring the necessary documentations to get a Real ID but she can process the standard DL today and I can get the Real ID upgrade for $14 at a later date. What she declined to mention, until I pressed, was that the Real ID and the standard DL is the same cost today. I didn't want to pay the extra $14 on a later date so I left the building to go home to get the documentations. When I came back about 30 minutes later, I was told by the same clerk that I needed to stand at the back of the line again. During this time, I saw a few people who stepped away from the counter to complete a required task and then were able to ""cut"" the line; I didn't see why I couldn't be allowed the same provision. Overall, the staff was friendly and once I had all the necessary documentation and waited the line, the process was smooth. However, I think staff could be more helpful  and forthcoming with information and signage could be more clear.",3

"I had a really good experience at the Anaconda DMV. Look, I’ve never felt the need to go out of my way to write a positive review about any state agency before and let’s be honest, the DMV is no ones favorite place to spend time, but my experience at the DMV today deserves my time to write something nice. The woman working was wonderful. She was funny and kind and mellow. She seemed genuine and friendly and easy going. Too often I’ve wanted to tear my hair out after a dmv visit (this includes living in other states) but someone with a positive attitude like the woman who helped me today can make a world of difference in how someone feels after leaving there. My appointment was also right on time which is a perk but hardly the defining factor.",5
"I had a really good experience at DMV which is normally not the case. This is the first time I've been there since covid came into play and I loved how calm and organized it was. The guy that helped me was nice and professional. It was clean and quiet. Honestly I hope it they keep it by appointment only, it was a much better experience.",5

"I had a hard time transferring title of a car, and have been to this location as well as the one in Bossier.  The Bossier location is very slow, the Shreveport one is better staffed and moves much faster.   Also Tara was so kind, smart and helpful, she helped me sort out the paperwork and finally, after 3 trips, get my paperwork sorted out properly.  She went above and beyond to help me.  I would hire her in a heartbeat, Express OMV is lucky to have such a kind and conscientious employee.

I gave the office 4 starts instead of 5 because on one of my earlier trips I worked with a different employee who was NOT helpful.  She found an error with my forms, handed them back to me and was rude.  As I walked away I heard her make a disparaging remark about me to a father and son who had been standing nearby listening to our conversation.  This employee (middle aged bottle blond with a desk in the far right corner as you come in the door), marred what is otherwise a well run business.  I would still go back, just stay away from the lady in the back right corner.",4

"I had a great experience with this place, especially with coronavirus hitting as hard as it did I couldn't get in to the DMV on time in order to renew my registration and they were very good with returning phone calls along with answering questions. I didn't realize that they would make it so convenient. I signed a few forms paid the Fees and a way they went to work! I will without a doubt be using them in the future because I could never stand going in the long lines and waiting all day to get everything done when they can do it for you. Five stars excellent service can't thank you enough",5

She even congratulated my son on his first vehicle!",5

"I had a great experience at this tag agency. In calling in advance, they suggested I get there as early as possible the next day to be sure to get an appointment. When I did so, I was given a time to return for the appointment, which allowed me to run a few errands and return, rather than have to just sit and wait. They were very punctual and efficient, with my appointment starting exactly on time, and finishing quickly. In and out in 15 minutes. What made it an especially good experience was fantastic Brenda, who exuded positivity and cheerfulness. She just brightened the whole atmosphere. She's a gem! I will definitely take all my auto/driving tag business here in the future. They made the entire experience pleasant. Thank you Brenda, for being so terrific.",5

"I feel as though I should write 2 reviews - Pre-COVID and post-COVID.

I've found everyone I've encountered here to be friendly and very helpful.  And that deserves a big kudo considering how boring taxes , license plates, etc must be.

I'm sure that post-COVID the personnel are still personable and willing to go the extra step to help an ""at the counter"" customer.

The problem is getting ANY sort of phone assistance.  Last spring when supposedly only one person was going in to the office,  I totally understood why no one was answering the telephones.   But it's almost June and they should now be fully staffed.  However, regardless what time of the day i call I receive the same recording - They're too busy to answer the phone.  No opportunity to leave a message;  just a man's voice telling the caller to try later.  Yeah - good luck  with that.",4
I failed twice here by the same examiner and same reasons. poor judgement at intersection10 points. poor judgement in traffic 10 points. Inattentive to traffic 10 points. Use mirror only 5 points. Even if I did perfect for K turn and parallel parking. They never let me pass the test.,1
"I failed the maneuverability test. Why? Well I lost several points because I misunderstood the position I was supposed to be in when you pull in. I came in parallel to the wrong cone. I said at that time that I had misunderstood what he had meant, yet at the end of the test when I repeated that I had misunderstood his instructions he replied that he was ""not a mind reader"" Neither am I. But the biggest loss of points was that I stopped too many times. Why am I angry for losing point from that? Two reasons. Number one, HE NEVER TOLD ME I COUDN'T STOP!!! How was I supposed to know??? It's not an intuitive thought. Which leads to number two. There is no law and no reason you should need to pull out and into a parking space without stopping! I understand this is general practice across the state, and I am not taking it into the rating. I am rating it poorly because the tester took off points for making mistakes he never even told me I wasn't supposed to make. He should have told me, there is no reason I should have known that before taking the test.",1

"I checked in using the QR code and got a number via text. It said to wait in the lobby and wait for our number to be called. I walked in with my brother and waited in the lobby.

A lady at the check in station rudely called us over and said, “YOU need to check in here. It says it right here.” I told her that we got a number through the code we scanned outside for the waitlist. She said, “it doesn’t matter, you need to check in right here. There is a sign.” She was rude and super unprofessional.

The sign just says Check In, but we were able to check in using the QR code and able to receive the waitlist number. So she gave us a new code and said the code we have does not matter. I thought okay, well sure. She directed us to the line we needed. We walked up and the lady at that line was also rude. She said with an attitude, “You need to wait for your number.” I told her that we have a code and a number the other lady gave us. She said, “You need to wait for your number to be called.” In an abrupt way.

She then called out the number that was on my phone (R953). My brother had (R955) on paper. We began to walk up there and she said again, “YOU NEED TO WAIT FOR YOUR NUMBER!!” I told her that number is on my phone and she said, “he has (55) and I said, “okay mam, I have 53 on my phone. So can we not check in using the QR code because it looks like you called my number. She then said it was a mistake on the other lady’s part and it wasn’t our fault.

By far the worst experience. Two older ladies that should be better with customer service. I would not hire them for the life of me. We didn’t go in there to be rude or ruins someone’s day, so to get that kind of treatment from the employees was terrible not only for the customers, but the business they work for.",1

"I can't believe I have to give even 1 star to this guy. Came in to register a vehicle purchased out of state, all required paperwork and vehicle are present. Tells me the insurance is the wrong type, claims the vehicle is not insured. I provide the insurance certificate with policy number and vehicle information. The policy has $1,000,000 commercial liability for my registered DBA so there's several vehicles under the policy. Claims it can't be used to register the vehicle when I've already registered over half a dozen vehicles the exact same way.

If there was a clerical error of some kind, that's one thing. Instead, this guy claims fraud, insults me, and rushes me out door... potentiality the worst customer service I've ever received.",1

i cancelled a plate on Aug 17. I was given a receipt saying so. It’s now October and I received a notification from the dmv saying I hadn’t cancelled my plates and would be fined. So I  called them and was basically told if I didn’t have a receipt it never happened and it wasn’t in the system. Found my copy called Dmv and guess what??? They never cancelled my tag but gave me an incomplete receipt. After I got it straight with Dmv  I called to let them know it wasn’t done so they could correct it in the future. Cara had an attitude from the moment I called. Very unprofessional doesn’t even cover this interaction. I will continue to use my old title service in Bossier. I just didn’t feel like driving that day.... FYI. You can cancel plates yourself at express lane. Org save the headache and attitude. I gave 1 star because zero isn’t an option. Won’t go back and won’t send friends . If she had been nice may be different we all screw up but don’t like attitudes,1

I explained I already had my ID with the correct name and I needed my title updated. After talking in circles with her because all she would say is title for title at me.

I asked for some paperwork and I kept getting them pointing at the signature part of the paperwork and told me sign here when ready but they have to witness it.

"I came here to get my Driver's License updated since I moved here from a different state and had gotten married so my id was no longer current. I called ahead to check what documents I would need. The woman we spoke to said basically all I needed was my marriage certificate for my name change. Social Security card wasn't needed either if I had already changed my name through SS, which I had. A bill to prove my address wasn't even needed since they said they could look that up. So we got there a few minutes before closing after the same woman on the phone assured us we could still get my DL done as long as we got there before closing. After I told the guy at the front desk what I was there for he said no you can only get any form of ID if you have your birth certificate or passport. He did not let me explain or help me figure out if I was asking for the wrong thing (is it updated DL? Renewed DL? Replaced DL?) He just flat out said nope you need birth certificate or passport and denied me service, walking straight out the door after me since it was 5pm. I wasn't rude. My only mistake was probably that I didn't tell him that I had been told otherwise just 2 minutes ago on the phone. But because he was short with me I was not even able to try.

Needless to say I am extremely angry that I went through all this stress and waiting to finally have a free moment to come here just to be told either the wrong info or have a guy that just wants to leave lie to me so he could go home. He wasn't even the guy who would have had to work with me. Now who knows when I will have another chance to go and I will need my ID updated to travel soon.",1

"I came here around December of 2019, I was trying to get plates for my car and I was under a lot of pressure from other things that was going on at that time but I still managed to be reasonable. I came here 2 separated times, the first time the guy told me that he couldn't get me my plates because he needed something the bill of sales. So I got the bill of sales for the 2nd day that I came and there was another issue because of what was missing on the bill of sales. The other guy that was there previously says, ""You had an attitude and that's not how you conduct business"". First and foremost, I explained that I had other things that was going on so if you can't do your job without taking everything personal then you shouldn't be in business especially when I could've just save $75+ by just going to the DMV which I did instead of returning back here. I did not appreciate being accused of an attitude just because I'm being myself. And so what if was stressed? We all have situations and and bad days but you're not going to bully me from being myself just because you're sensitive. I didn't have to smile every second around you just because you hate attitudes. I conducted myself well and you or whoever was there should've did the same. If you cannot consider that someone may be dealing with something which I was then you shouldn't be doing any customer service job especially when your job was a thousand times easier than my customer service job driving school buses.",1

When we came last year to take care of our cars, they were super nice then too.  It was so frustrating because of Covid and they were very accommodating.",5
I called to see if they offer title services on the phone and was put on hold for 8 minutes so hanged up. I went to the place since is close by where I work at and Kim I believe is her name was with another lady talking on her desk. She said she will be attending me shortly. After 20 mins of my arrive  two other customers showed up and she finally finished talking to the lady which was a coworker next to her office. She skipped the other two workers ahead of me and didn’t a knowledge me at all. I won’t recommend this place to anyone. Around almost an hour pass after Kim finished attending them and she continue talking to her coworker. I just walked out and happy I didn’t contracted her.,1
"I called to see if someone can answer some DMV questions for me since the DMV was experiencing high call volume. Anyway, I called and he answered ""DMV dude dmv services"". I asked him ""hey can you answer some questions for me"", right away he told me I have to call you back and hung up on me. Absolutely ridiculous and horrible customer service. He didn't ask for my name or info to call me back. If he had a customer in front of him or another call he could have just said ""I have another call, let me get your name and number"" or ""hey I have a customer here let me get your information and will call you back."" I'm sure I could have used his services but he didn't even ask what I needed help with. Rude af!",1

"I called to deal with a minor issue and politely expressed frustration with a policy that required me to pay an additional fee. The representative I spoke with starting shouting at me and I had to calm her down. She denied me a supervisor saying ""they were unavailable and would tell me the say thing anyway"". I got tired of the rep aggressively arguing with me and agreed to pay the fee. She then flew off the handle when I said ""Fine how do I pay your fee"", she went into a yelling tirade and I had to try to calm her down again. I then again asked to speak to a supervisor and she said she would relay my information, I said ""good do it then!"" She then starting yelling over me trying to speak as calmly as I could at this point. I admit I shouted a few times at that point but this was absolutely absurd. She then hung up while yelling into the receiver! I work customer service for a living and I understand it's a difficult job but this behavior was absolutely UNACCEPTABLE! If I had behaved like this at any of the customer service positions I have held, I would most certainly have been fired. She was rude, argumentative, uncaring, and extremely unprofessional! The behavior was like that of a angry belligerent customer, not of a customer service representative. This was by far the worst customer service experience I have ever had the displeasure to experience. Please don't let this happen again.",1

The phone call was transferred to the courthouse after I had called several times receiving the recording.

I was told that they are really busy at the general store and usually CAN'T answer the phone, the lady answered my question and I immediately left for the general store that's less than five minutes from my house.

I WAS LITERALLY THE ONLY CUSTOMER IN THE BUILDING AT 1PM.

I have NUMEROUS complaints about the ineptitude of the employees and when attempting to redress these issues I'm told that I should just deal with it.

The absolute worst part is that the same employees that are the root of these issues bounce between the general store and the courthouse so you can't just choose to go to one or the other.",1
"I called the day I received the notice that my title work was in. No appointments available for over a month. By that time, my  temporary plates are expired. The woman on the phone said to come early, people line up at 6:15 am. You have to take a number and she said you would be called between 12 and 5???? How is this OK on any level? I work all week and don't have time to sit all day waiting. What about Covid--do they have places for people to safely wait? Why is the Laurel office closed? This is bureaucracy at its finest... give people deadlines that must be met but then make it impossible for them to meet those deadlines.",1

My problem was resolved within a 5 min phone call. I thanked her and told her to have a great day. She wished the same for me.
I feel like only the angry customers leave reviews, so I just wanted to say I appreciate all the wonderful people that work here. Customer service is a thankless job. Be kind.",5

When I got there I signed in and sat there for over an hour watching the screen to see when my number was going to show - it never did, so the woman at the Help Desk had them put my number back in the system so I would be called. But when I was called, they told me I had to come back because they needed my Birth Certificate, Proof of Residents (my current address was on my I.D. card that I had). What a wasted trip and cost for a Cab to get there and back home.",1

I called and when the lady answered she got distracted with other coworkers and forgot she had answered the phone. I listened to their conversation for about 10 minutes while shouting “hello” to let them know I was on the line. I ended up hanging up and when I called back the same exact thing happened.,1

I called and asked to speak to a supervisor and was put on hold for 15 minutes and the original person got back on the phone and said there was no supervisor there at all. Every person I spoke to was very rude and didn’t even help me out. I was trying to pay two months in advance but they told me I couldn’t do that and another payment would be due the next month. They try and make as much money as they can from each case and this is something from three years ago. They wouldn’t even let me have time to straighten things out with the IRS. They threatened to garnish my wages if I didn’t pay how they wanted. They should all be fired I’ve never been around such rude and dishonest group of people thumbs down.,1
"I called ahead with some questions, and a little later, when he knew he wasn’t going to be in the office around the time I planned to arrive, Mr. Everett called me himself to let me know — I didn’t have an appointment; it was just a kind gesture to save me a drive. I really appreciated this, and when I came in the following day, he remembered me and our conversation. Service was fast, and I was grateful to be working with a good human. Highly recommend!",5

Its very disappointing since they have a GREAT place in Sulphur that I have been to and the people are so nice ;and friendly and FAST!! I asked for the tags to be sent there but for some reason they did not.
Very frustrating!!

"I am the property owner of 1802 Blanton St. Mr. Steve Grimes (DOT contractor) contracted a moving company to move a family displaced by the SE 540 project. This moving company knocked my mailbox down TWICE and attempted to hide the damage by jamming the box back into the ground and zip tying it. I have contacted Mr. Grimes multiple times with an unprofessional response of blaming it in the tenants moving in. This incident was witnessed by the new tenants, the neighbors, as well as the Real Estate Agent involved in the negotiations for rental. Mr. Steve Grimes has ignored requests for repair from myself as well as the above mentioned Real Estate Agent. In addition to the mailbox issue, the signed lease agreement stated 2 years of rent paid in full. Currently the tenants are in breach of the contract due to almost 30 days of waiting for payment from Mr. Grimes.

This may not be her job role, but is her responsibility to ensure we are provided adequate service.

"I am out of state military, originally from Oregon, and mailed in all the listed required documents to register my car 6 months ago. I was just told it will be at least another 5 weeks to process an additional document that 1) wasn’t listed under their required documents and 2) they lost the first time I sent it in. They never bothered to tell me they needed the document or that they lost it. I had to call and be on hold for over an hour before talking to someone who took 20 minutes to figure out what was going on. They are polite enough on the phone but it is clear that there is no desire to actually be helpful or fix their mistakes. They basically said your request now goes back to the end of the 5 week line. Why does it take 5 weeks to look at an additional document, check a box, and put the title/plates in the mail? I registered my other car in the state I am living in and was able to walk in and have everything taken care of in less than 10 minutes. I literally handed them the same basic documents and they handed me the plates and registration. I don’t know how Oregon has managed to make something that should be so basic and easy into something so painful and drawn out.  At this point they  have my title and have cashed my payment check and there is literally nothing I can do to undo the mistake of trusting them to do this basic function and nothing they will do to make up for their months of ineptitude.",1

I had to call and be on hold for over an hour before talking to someone who took 20 minutes to figure out what was going on. They are polite enough on the phone but it is clear that there is no desire to actually be helpful or fix their mistakes. They basically said your request now goes back to the end of the 5 week line. Why does it take 5 weeks to look at an additional document, check a box, and put the title/plates in the mail? I registered my other car in the state I am living in and was able to walk in and have everything taken care of in less than 10 minutes. I literally handed them the same basic documents and they handed me the plates and registration. I don’t know how Oregon has managed to make something that should be so basic and easy into something so painful and drawn out.  At this point they  have my title and have cashed my payment check and there is literally nothing I can do to undo the mistake of trusting them to do this basic function and nothing they will do to make up for their months of ineptitude.",1

"I am absolutely stunned here.  I am Active Duty Military and was completely disrespected by the representative. I left New York because of a permanent change of station and now work in Georgia.  New York suspended my license and registration without warning me, because I changed my Auto Policy to Georgia.

Upon notification of my suspension (6 months after the suspension!!!) I faxed all documents asked for by one of their reps and gave them a week.  I called back more than a week later and they rep REFUSED to help.  When I asked if she could check on the status, she responded with ""Is this a statement or question, because I'm going to move on to the next caller"".  I asked to speak her supervisor and she said ""they don't get on the phone"".  When I demanded to speak to a supervisor, she hung up on me.

Understand I pleaded with her to check on my status.  All I am trying to do remove the suspension, so I can register my cars in GA and get a license here because I will never return to NY.  I tried to explain I'm active duty and this is effecting me horribly. She did not care nor would she listen.  She just gave me attitude and hung up.

Does anyone know of a complaint department or way to report this person?  This is the worse kind of person.",1

The staff do not play around they get to you help you and keep structure in the process . That title clerk made sure she acknowledged every single person who walked in the door everyone! I only gave 3 stars due to the condition of the building , and the fact that the phone tree is broken; I digress these clerks deserve a raise to have to sit like that all day vs us being tortured for what one hour at the most .

They make it a horrible experience when it should be a pleasant encounter. I watched them be mean to everyone. They appear to hate their jobs. If you are that unhappy find a new job. There are job openings everywhere right not just don’t find one working with the public.,1
"Horrible service and personnel! I waited over an hour in line to have a mistake, they made, corrected on my vehicle registration, only to be told come back on Monday.  The Tax Collector is out ill and his deputies decided to take the day off! I have three issues here: One, if you are too ill to be at your duty post, why are you running for elected office? Come next election cycle, he will not be too ill to ask for my vote, which is a NO; two, who is running the office when all the supervisors are out; third,  there needs to be a designated chain of command who are authorized to correct mistakes made by the Collector's office!",1
Horrible policies. Only one employee is smart enough to do title transfers. you have too wait hours because they give other functions priority.,1

"Horrible office and incredibly rude staff that welcome you. Customer Service is a class that needs to be required during their job orientation before hiring. If any issues appear in the system for you to get your license changed, then they share it with you after they have completed everything with you. I sat with some staff member for 45 minutes to an hour going over everything with him, and at the ending when I was about to get my license something went wrong. They wouldn't even help me fix the issue, and they could have helped me contact the appropriate people to figure out what is going on. Unfortunately I can't reach the office I have to speak with but they definitely could. Unfortunately they just won't take the time to. I even spent 3 hours on the road to get into town to take care of my license change since they are backed up with appointments all the way into January of 2021. Incredibly unprofessional. I suggest you go to another office with considerate and intelligent associates. I am never visiting that office again.",1
"Horrible licensing Agency.
Cam in to register my new Peugeot 406, they told me I had to provide a value for the car. They said go to the dealer and get a value for the car...a Peugeot dealer???? Where! After that they said that they cannot help me at all!
Everyone in this branch needs to go to Olympia to relearn how to take care of customers and how to do the job that they are there for. HORRIBLE place!!!!!!

I went to Canyon Park Licensing and was in an out within 10min,  I gave them my paperwork, they printed the value of line and that was it.",1

"Horrible horrible- literally the least knowledgeable DMV staff in this area. And so lacking in kindness, courtesy, compassion for their fellow human beings. Unbelievably rude and disrespectful for absolutely no reason. Please, if you hate your job this much, go find a different job so you are happy and so are the humans that must interact with you. There is one young lady who works here who is knowledgeable and nice- if you get her to help you, you’ve won the lottery at this place. I honestly don’t know how she works at such a stressful place surrounded with so much negativity. God bless her and help her find a happier place. After visiting this location 5 times in 2 days, we finally gave up, went to a different license plate office in Durham, got our work done, and were so relieved that there are some locations with decent and competent folks who believe their job is to serve customers and not put road blocks in their way. The location on hwy 55 is not a place you would want to go by choice. Avoid it, save your time, and go to a different location.",1

Horrible experience. Someone should guide people to be sure they have correct documents before they wait 2 hours. The insurance expires in 4 months and they would not accept. They were so rude.,1
"Horrible experience. Lady named Charlene seemed to hate her entire existence. This woman was extremely condescending, judgmental, and rude . All I wanted was to get my plates and when I gave her my paper work for what I needed , she handed it back to me and said they couldn’t help me because the paper I was giving her was not the original she states that the signature need to be “wet” And that I would also need to provide job titles for the signatures that were on my paperwork. I had to walk away from her toxicity.I wished her day got better. Right after I went to the next dmv up the street and I walked out with my plates 10 mins later. If you don’t like your job don’t take it out on the customers, Remember you are the one who signed up for this , NOT US !",1
"Horrible experience, trying to chance from GA to Tennessee.   First made an appointment carried evidence of new address and our Ga DL.   Had to come back with a Marriage certificate and birth certificate.   I'm in my sixty's have had a previous TN DL and the same last name for 30 years.   Went back the next day was told to do a scan with  my home.   Took my husband's but wouldn't take mine.   Makes me regret moving from GA.  They made it so much easier to go from TN to Ga",1
Horrible experience!!! My wife and had to go back a total of four times. Ms Tucker was extremely rude and unprofessional and was not clear on what we needed. She was very unclear concerning items we needed and made it a bad experience. Not to mention how argumentative she was and it’s hard to believe she’s a supervisor!  Plus COVID-19 just made a bad place worse.,1
"Horrible experience there. I couldn't get a license because my passport could not be validated. At first I was told that I needed to call the immigration department to find out what was wrong with my passport. I think they told me that just so I would leave but I called while I was there. After 15+ minutes of being on hold with immigration I got disconnected. So the employee tried entering my information again.  My passport still could not be validated and was then told that they had recently done a system upgrade and that the passport validations weren't working.
I wasn't going to write a review but when I got home later and thought about it, I realized that if they knew their system was having problems why would they make me believe there was an issue with my passport. If I hadn't stuck around until they told me about their systems problem I'd probably still be trying to get in touch with immigration to figure out what was wrong with my passport.
To top it off I returned later with a copy of my birth certificate and was told a copy was unacceptable. I tried calling ahead of time to find out if a copy was acceptable. However when I called no one picked up the phone for 20+ minutes. When I arrived a few minutes after finally hanging up, there was no one waiting to be serviced, which makes me believe they ignore incoming calls.
This morning I went to the regular DMV and was in and out of there in 40 minutes, and of course there was nothing wrong with my passport. Why anyone would go to this MVD Express and pay an extra fee, when the real DMV is just a few miles down the road on Montgomery, is beyond me.
I don't really blame the young adults who are working there, for probably minimum wage, I blame management for what happened. The employees made phone calls to their superiors to see how to handle my passport situation and I assume they were telling me what their supervisors told them to say.",1
Horrible experience it’s really a pandemic out here and I can’t even have a service that was created for humans like me. Let alone the American rescue plan is in effect and this state is not allowing benefits to be paid for the unemployment at all. All of the representatives are unable to assist with any questions other than what’s written on paper to tell their applicants. I want to kill myself literally I can’t feed my babies!!!!!,1

I wanted my new vehicle to have 1 year of registration. The lady only gave me a new plate with one month left on my about to registration. Absolutely horrible never again will I go here or tell my friends not to come here.

Horrible communication. Sat outside for an hour. The line never moved. I don’t understand why this process is so bad.,1
Horrible clerks. They ask vague questions so that they can charge you more money. They lie to get their way. Be careful how. You answer their questions. One of their clerks lied and said they asked me a question when they didn’t. And the question they did ask was vague and they didn’t ask specifically. Guess what they added $400 more to my tag fee. In a pandemic!! When people are struggling to pay bills. Train your clerks to be more personal and don’t just go on asking questions that are so open needed and not specific to that person at all. Just to charge them more money. Admit to your mistakes when someone calls asking a question!! Rude staff!,1
"Horrible and disgusting customer service… the lady who helped us at window #2 had a disgusting and aggressive attitude.
This is not the first time I come here and every time is the same, I just don’t understand why people keeps working at this place
it is very sad because I see so many unhappy customers providing there reviews and no one does anything about it.",1

Arrived at 11:30am, got served a little after 1pm. I was in the green ticket line too which was significantly slower (new to Washington, so I was transferring my registration and plates to this state.)

"Honestly the REPS. at the RMV were lovely the greeter was a monster. I made an appointment several days ago to register my recently purchased vehicle. Literally, same day I bought the car. And you have LEGALLY in MA 7 days to register your vehicle. Anyway it was $100 more than I had expected. I had to wait to get more money.I tried  to schedule another appointment but they were booked up. The RMV rep. I was working with told me to just show up as there are many cancellations and scheduling always leaves less spots for walkins.

Fast forward to day 4 I have my vehicle and all my documents and a case document they could just pull up and ring me out. I walk in and some older woman, demanded she know why I didn’t schedule online. In the most rude and condescending manner. I believe this battle axe to be the rare Silver Karen. Who predates the modern genus “Karen”.

I explained I am aware of the scheduling online and was not able to attain a date, yet was still recommended by the staff that with the one missing document I’d be an easy transaction and should come as a walk in.

Silver Karen, asked for my paperwork so she could see who previously handled my transaction. And berated me for the audacity to walk-in while they were so “busy”. (Honestly its the first time I’ve even been to the RMV where it was NOT BUSY). I refused to allow this club wielding troglodyte to thump at a co-worker who was trying to be helpful as most customer facing personnel should do. Silver Karen said it would extend my visit if she did not give me a specific assignment. I accepted the consequence.

Around 7-9 minutes later I left the RMV with my registered vehicle packet and thanked the Silver Karen for her patience.",2
"Honestly seen a lot of negative comments but I guess they went there for different things...

I went there to get married and honestly it was the best marriage I could've asked for even if it was just a little small get together for the time being.

The county clerk that married us was extremely nice and so funny not only did she help us get married she also took photos afterwards

06/16/2021 was the day of me and my husband's first and forever marriage.

Thank you county clerks office.",5

"Here it is. I was driving down Route 5. First time I had cause to be on that road in a number of years. Nothing had changed, except the potholes were bigger and deeper. The road has been falling apart for years, and it is Very high traffic. And fast traffic.  So after a day at the High School State Championships for Skiing, we decided to celebrate by having dinner and exited on to Route 5. BIG MISTAKE!  After getting on this crazy highway, I soon hit a pothole that blew out, not one, but two of my tires. (Due to the traffic and keeping with the speed limit, there was no way to avoid hole.) My tires were only a couple of months old. It was cold and freezing drizzle. The tow truck came, but only one of us could ride. So me, my daughter and friend walked a little less than mile to tow company. When the tires had been replaced by Town Fair ($360) my husband came back and got us...we went to eat. That all worked out ok an we only lost an hour. Upon calling this dept, I was referred to another # that had a recording saying no reimbursements for defects in highways that cause damage. This was my heating bill, it was really hard on us and a month later are still trying to catch up. What I don't understand is this.....1.) This highway heas been in this state far too many years, especially for the amount of traffic. 2.) If you aren't going to repair it, lower the speed limits, cars fly on this road.  3.) How can you not take responsibility for my damage.  What if I had wrecked and someone was injured? Or worse.   4.) That you are going to wait until this road kills someone to repair it. 5.)Why are contractors responsible to pay for damage caused but the State isn't.  I traveled that road for many years an it did a number on the structure of my old car. I'm a little angry they won't take responsibility for this.  HOWEVER, the recording goes on to say that if in a construction area to send them a letter and they will pass it to the contractors,  who will be responsible to pay. Makes no sense at all. The road sucks...fix it.",1

You definitely need an appointment to get in. They check at the door. I went in to renew my vehicle registration. If you are one of those to leave things at last minute, don’t get discouraged. After trying to make an appointment for the month of August 2021, there were no openings until mid September. I freaked out! I still went in, hoping they’d still see me.  I was advised to continue checking for openings because people cancel. I did until something became available. My appointment was at 2:45. I got there at 2:20. They took care of me in 15 mins. Easy breezy. They were very nice in this place 😊. So far a great experience!!",5

"Having everything handled by the staff at the MVD Express in Roswell was an outstanding experience. Having recently relocated to Roswell from out of state, my wife and I needed new driver's licenses, new registration, new title -- the works. Alex, Jacqueline, and Norela handled everything expertly. They were professional, personable, and had a great sense of humor. What could have been a tedious, unpleasant chore, instead turned into an enjoyable experience. I would wholeheartedly recommend MVD Express in Roswell, NM to anyone who needs their type of services.",5
Having done my driver's test six times. The station is quite different and confusing. The officers give different rules that will effectively fail you. They also judge you based on your color. I didn't like it at all. I shared my frustration with the person in charge. I guess they don't read the same script.,1

"Have been trying to get something finalized for a few months and today was the deadline. And every time i made an appointment and went … they would continuously deny me and say i only needed ONE extra document. 4 visits later and “4” needed docs later this is still an issue. It’s becoming aggravating and feels borderline like reactive abuse. Any sane person would go mad. They refuse to tell you everything at once and now even when i started MONTHS ago i still missed the deadline because of their twisted troll. People need to be cut. A lot of them.

Update: i guess someone in the customer service department doesnt want to earn her salary. I answered one question respectfully and she put me back on the wait list. And another lady literally said i can only do it this way. One by one. One visit and one document at a time",1

I was out by 8:45am with new NC license (from out of state) in hand. Everyone was super nice. Easy process but have all your docs ready. Need paper copy of insurance. Best experience at a DMV ever.,5
"Had an appointment for 1:40 (you can make an appointment online and save hours of your time). Got there at around 1:14, my documents were checked to be complete and I was given a number. By 1:55 everything was done. Definitely make an appointment beforehand!",5

Had an 11:00 appointment for my elderly mother. Get there 15 minutes early to have an ID made. Didn't leave until 12:50. What is the point of having an appointment if you still have to wait with the walk-ins?? I hope Timesavers opens back up,1

"Had a truly awful experience (even as far as usual DMV trips are concerned). Highly unorganized. Please do not trust the ""estimated wait times"" online or you may be sorely disappointed. There is no communication at the entrance about who needs to wait in line. The main entrance is jam-packed with people while everyone waits to go through security to wait in yet another line. COVID is not new at this point but this location is continuing to severely struggle with flow and transparency.",1

"Had a surprisingly great experience at the MVA of Gaithersburg! I went in with the lowest of low expectations but everything went quite smoothly. I did bring all of the correct documentation which definitely contributed to how well things flowed. If I didn't it could have been another story. But today I was very pleased with how short the wait time was (with an appt.), how polite and helpful people were, and that no one seemed to be out of their mind miserable. The only negative would be that I already had a lot of anxiety going into this experience and once I checked in was told I needed to call my car insurance company while I waited to obtain an MD policy/policy #, as apparently that has to happen while at the MVA. I literally finished my call with the info. I needed right as my number was called, so that was incredibly stressful. As someone who tries to be as prepared as possible to alleviate some of my anxiety, I didn't love that last minute instruction.",4
"Had a super good experience, they made everything happened that i needed to on short notice. so glade i chose to come here instead of the dmv.",5
"Had a really great experience with Diana at the County Clerk's Office.
I had a complex out of state transfer.

Remembered the visit when I returned 2 weeks later, and efficiently completed the transfer.

"Had a great experience here this week. I was able to schedule an appointment online for the written test (had an out of state license so the test is a requirement). Checking in was quick and easy; hardly any wait. Maybe 3-5 mins max.

Got in to take the test. As long as you're prepared and have taken advantage of online practice tests, the test is easy. Every interaction I had with the staff was great. Everyone was friendly and helpful.

For those taking the road test (I had to do this as well-expired license during the pandemic), check out YouTube videos for Arden Hills. There are a couple videos that are great preparation for the road test.

I know there are several bad reviews, but my experience was great. I came prepared and it made the process smooth and easy.",5

For all of my other license photos they at least include your neck and maybe your shoulders, this license office took the photo so close that my face fills the entire square.

"Great School! I highly recommend this school. I took my 30 hour course here and my 3 in-cars with Mike's Driving School

Starting with the 30 hour course, the instructor taught us everything we need to know in a fun entertaining way. The class wasn't boring and I was able to get all the information I needed to easily pass my permit test!

With my in-cars, they actually helped me strengthen my weaknesses in driving. Example: During my second in-car, I wasn't good at parking. For the next 45 minutes, my instructor taught me how to park, and we practiced multiple times.  I have been using what they taught since.

Today I received my license after easily passing the driving test. This school prepared me well and I'm more than happy with my experience.",5

Not crowded at all only about 10-15 people. I went at around 10am. The bathrooms are in the front when you walk in to the right. Single person bathrooms (1male&1female) and  are clean for those who are traveling.

When you walk in security will ask if you have an appointment. Then will ask you to  fill out a form. Once you filled it out go to counter 1. You will be given a ticket number to wait for your turn. Staff was friendly as well and patient. Overall, I was able to get everything in 45 mins.

Glad to know DMV Express does hold true to its name.",5

"Great experience at this MVA. Yes, you will have to wait…I just scrolled through my phone and read a book, enjoying the break from my workday. The alternative is more government spending on employees here, and I think there are better places to use our tax dollars.

I was able to get an appt online about a week out. When you arrive, you wait in line to check in. An employee came down the line making sure everyone was where they needed to be. The line moved quickly. After check in, I waited a bit in the waiting room, numbers were constantly being called.

Once my number was called, my service was efficiently completed in just a few minutes. All of the records I needed were in their system, I just had to show my ID.  I arrived at 9:30 for my 9:45 appointment, and was out of the building by 10:15. Do your research online to make sure you have all the forms you need. The website could be easier to use, but the info is all there.

The interior is bright and clean. There is plenty of seating, and ample parking outside. All the employees I spoke with were polite and knowledgeable.",5

Go here first! Very efficient staff and spacious waiting area inside. Got here at about 8:30 AM with 10 people in front of me. Was out by 8:45 AM having to do two registrations. Staff even accommodated folks who had to get out of line for inspection and let them get back into line where they originally belonged. A refreshing experience you should try!,5

Our DPS agent was Wonderful and made the experience enjoyable from start to finish. She commented on the fact that we were so prepared, yet I give credit to the website.

BUT, in order to handle a better volume of people during the pandemic, they should totally drop the appointment system and let people wait in cars outside by a number system and then only allow 8 - 10 customers (or numbers) in the building.

Whether it's hot or raining or cold, people's cars would keep them comfortable until their number is called.

In other words, make the parking lot the waiting lobby, instead of getting on an appointment list that is months long.",4

Friendly and fast especially with the amount of people who go there for a real id or license.. my advice is to get there early because the line of people that's there around 9am and 10am gets ridiculous long and make sure you have the money on a bank card or credit card because they're not accepting cash at this time due to covid-19,4

This doesn't mean one can schedule tomorrow, maybe only they will tell us when we can schedule. The fact they don't answer the phone, don't return calls or emails is the part that's inexcusable.

I went there for blue letter and driving license renewal. First the guy at the front door asked why I am there, went and came with another person. He asked for the required documents, then took me to his desk. After he completed his work, He directed to the next desk and transferred my documentation directly to that desk. There I got my new driving license. They are very friendly. To the point. You may feel this a lot exaggerated, but my mind was blown.",5
"For something as simple as a title transfer, every employee I had spoken with (I had to make multiple appts and deal with multiple people due to the difference of what I was told) was completely out of touch with the process. As it was communicated to me, I need to buy two titles and wait two weeks to apply for a new one for no apparent reason to remove the name of a third party which was included on the original. This is redundant to me rather than just get a new one with just my name. I was already upset with having to pay a late fee because the us mail service is so slow which only left me 3 days to make an appointment. When expressing this frustration to the clerk, she replied by saying “that’s just the way it is” and tried to say it was the leasing companies fault more than their own, but I had told her that is not a valid reason and asked her “who are the ones collecting the fee at the end of the day?” And she had chuckled and said “well we have to be consistent.”  I wouldn’t be employed if I treated people the way I was treated there if I were at my job.

"FLOOR 11 for appointments and FLOOR 12 fingerprints
The service is good BUT in cases of urgency or lack of a temporary stamp or any question, an appointment must be made on the web. Neither on the 11th nor the 12th floor they receive without an appointment. They took my fingerprints and they had to put the stamp on me indicating that my new green card is in process. They gave me no evidence and I followed the entire procedure. With USCIS you have to go ahead and make an appointment two weeks before at least to anticipate these cases.

In 2020, I was told that I needed my marriage certificate. In April 2021, I had a copy of my birth certificate and needed the original. Today was told I had everything but proof of address with a bill. Why tell us to go paperless and then ask for papers? I couldn't get the Government license for the airplane so I got the general, which gives me three years instead of four. It's really frustrating but with all the identity theft, I understand you can never be too careful. My experience at the Dollar Tree is always pleasant.",3

"First off this Building is well hidden and Google maps takes you about a mile away. It took the custodian at my first stop to come outside the bldg he was in and literally point to where I needed to go to get my Driver's license renewed. Once I got to the parking area I noticed that the parking lot blocks you in any of the arteries you happen to pull in. You have to go back out the way you pulled in. Pointing out the obvious that Kentucky Dept of Licensing didn't thoughtfully plan out their move from Winchester Rd. And not making  modifying the parking lot to accommodate it's parton's.
Once there if doing walk-ins, you have to get out of your car and approach the person with the clipboard outside of the building. He or she will get your name, take your cell number to be put in line to be called. Once called you once again have to stand on the walkway and wait on the inside staff to point you in. It being a very cold day today was not the time for anyone to be standing outside on the walkway in line. I saw women with small children freezing while they waited. That alone made me realize that the staff was not organized or had not planned out anything.
Once I was called in, the young lady was rude, that directed me to stand on a red line and wait to be called. I could tell that she had no people skills and was very harsh in the way she was talking to people.
So if you need to go here for renewal, written, be sure to go kinda early. If not the walk up list will be too full to get you in.",2
First off there is no legal services for the state during a PANDEMIC from the American Rescue plan 2021 and they have turned unemployment insurance services off for those in need and have children to feed. I feel that this is unfair and unjust that we have to continue suffering for something we can't even control.

"First great Dmv experience. I hate spending all day at the state dmv and especially with rude workers. A couple of my buddies have recommended Mvd pros to me so I decided to give them a chance. Even though I was missing a form, the guy that attended me was very helpful and courteous.  He explained to me exactly what I needed and was able to come right back and finish my registration. I also liked that they actually follow COVID protocols and ensure everyone in their office is wearing their mask as well as keeping it very clean.",5

Very helpful",5
"Finding an appointment was extremely difficult (as it has been for everyone), I moved to NJ two months ago and my tags expire this month so I was anxious about completing the transfer process.

I was looking yesterday and found an appointment available at the South Brunswick location, it was a little drive for me, but well worth it!! I was there today and missing a piece of paperwork, the attendant who gives you a number was so kind and helpful (as were the security guards, and gentleman directing people).  I'm already happy with the customer service that I have experienced this far! Thank you South Brunswick for helping relieve some stress!!",5
"Finding a solid notary service is not always a walk in the park, especially during COVID-19 times. The system they had in place dealing with COVID-19 was not only standard but was better than most places at hand. The clerk I had was extremely helpful and kind in her actions and words. I can not recommend a better place to have all of your messenger needs taken care of.",5

"Fast service.  Open on weekend.  No hassle. Walked out with my plates in hand.

Arrived right at opening.  The line had already formed, but the other license places aren't even open on Saturdays, so I decided to wait.  It was probably 15 to 20 minutes, not bad.

I was just transferring my title from CA to WA.  Nothing complicated.  Had title, bill of sale, and other paperwork just in case.

I had been to 3 other license places, one in Redmond, one in Federal Way and one in Tacoma....  Each place said I was missing some form of paperwork....  I told them I had everything...  one place was super rude and even refused to serve me because my cosigner wasn't there (he's disabled, elderly and living in CA- so that wasn't even possible).

Here at A Plus, it was no hassle.  People were really kind and sweet.  The process went fast and easy.  They didn't even need the paperwork other places requested.  It was so easy and I was so relieved and happy with the service.  Don't drive to federal way or Redmond.  Go here.  This was such a weight off my shoulders.

Thank you A Plus.  You earned an A+ on your service today.",5

Very, very impressed. Highly Recommend.

UPDATE: So I went back for the appointment this week. It was very organized, token and all. There is a wait time for your token to get called (mine was 60 minutes), cant help it I guess for the size of the DMV. They do have many counters so it moves.

While waiting another man who arrived after us just walks right in, in front of us while the security guard doesn’t say a thing to him. Another man walks out and holds the door for us saying we could go in now so we start to enter. Security guard blocks us and says, “you can only come in when I tell you to!”  He waits a couple seconds like he’s on a power trip and then let’s us in. Couldn’t tell if it was a female or race thing since the man who was able to cut in front of us and walk in without being asked to wait outside was the same skin color as the security officer? Very unpleasant demeanor and experience with him. The woman who helped us however was very sweet and efficient.",3

Extremely rude customer service. The lady at the information desk didn't speak English fluently. The gentleman in front of me actually walked out after he tried several times to explain to her in perfect English what he needed. I tried to write down on paper that I needed stickers for my tags. This insulted the lady so I tried to tell her what I needed. After not understanding her she started screaming at me as if I couldn't hear. Fortunately another person came over to assist the non speaking woman. Good job DMV hiring two people to do one job. That's our tax dollars being spent extremely stupid by our retarded government.,5

Extremely quick and very nice. Under 10 min to renew auro registration.,5

"Extremely happy with their classes!! I took their 10-hour package this summer. The instructors make sure you are fully trained with everything- parallel parking, emergency maneuvering, highway driving once you’re behind the wheel. The instructors are very friendly and give you feedback after every class which is helpful. I highly recommend this place for anyone who is new to driving.",5

Extremely fast and efficient! The lady who handled our registration renewal was also very polite and friendly. Definitely a better experience than in Lexington.,5
"Extremely disappointed in Perkins Rd. DMV Express.  It Started with making an appointment that the website offers. This means absolutely NOTHING. Went in to process a Real ID and had to wait an hour- no acknowledgement of the appointment that was made on their official site. Waited for an hour for my name to be called. Was turned away because my original, authentic ""Raised Seal"" Birth Certificate from New York State was not a ""Long Form"". What is a long form ??? This is the same birth Certificate I have used my entire life of 53 years for all vital documentation INCLUDING my Louisiana Driver's license. The representative was dismissive of my questioning this rejection. Her lame explanation was ""Louisiana is cracking down on out of state birth Certificates""- what does that mean.???? When I asked her why do they accept this original birth certificate to get my regular drivers license, she replied ""I can't answer that and walked away from her station. If she was wearing a name tag or actually shared her name, I would be posting it.",1

Expected a wait without an appt. But to keep getting bumped no matter when an appt. Came in (late and paperwork incomplete usually) so multiple holds to me while they did what should have been done before was excessive. Staff is very pleasant but the policy to keep resetting people after checkin was unwarranted.,3

"Expect to wait unrealistic periods of time to take the driving test. I went there at 10 am and they told me to wait 3 hours until my turn comes after which they will call me. I left, went home, and said I wi come back when they call. Once they called, they said that I shouldn't have left and that I am at the end of the line. I took my test 4:30 of the same day. It took a whole day to do it.

If you don't have a car and are renting by the hour, reconsider. You will pay an ungodly sum of money.",1

Employees were helpful and polite. DMV needs to put more detailed instructions on their website. Would have been nice to know that Nc doesn't use any paperwork where your middle name is just the initial. I wouldn't have drove an hour and wasted their time and mine.

Employee ID 32921 is an absolute horror of a person. The level in which she talks to people is absolutely horrendous. She had ask for a placard that had already been issued to me and tried to take it away. When I ask her to speak to a supervisor she threw her hand in the air and just talked to me like I'm a child. It's pathetic that they are able to do things like this and get away with it. They have zero accountability for their employees. I will be calling the county office to make a formal complaint,1

"Due to new law, you need your birth certificate or passport to RENEW you license. So don't forget that, or you would have wasted an entire working day like I did, sitting in a giant cesspool of a waiting room.

Do not confuse having an appointment with being timely. I waited just under 2.5 hours. I even saw how slow it was going, went and had lunch, came back and waited another 30 minutes. Only to be told, I didn't have the proper OTHER forms of ID so I could renew my authentic ID I already presented.

"DRIVERS TEST IS RIGGED

One of the questions were:
“A person who is on their cell phone is ____ to get into a car accident than someone who is not on their cell phone.”

A: 4 times more likely (Correct Answer)

B: 2 times more likely

C: 8 times more likely (My Answer)

I asked the desk people how this question makes sense? They told me that they don’t know, but they said that the test is based on their manual/booklet.

If anybody knows what question I’m talking about please correct me if I’m wrong. I’m just trying to figure out why 4 times more likely is the correct answer over 8 times or 2 times?",1

"Don't really understand the point of making an appointment. I had my appointment at 10:50 am, showed up at 10:30. I was told I need to wait till my appointed time. Meanwhile, people on regular line kept going in. I thought, fine, since I have an appointment once I go in, it should be 1-2-3. I go in and get my ticket, but there's no separate service for people with appointment. You're part of the same pile. As I had arrived 20 mins earlier, if I had ignored my appointment and just walked in with the people on the regular line, I probably would have gotten my ticket before 4-5 people.

Don't be surprised once you arrive if there is a long wait. The good news is they have an excellent system for predicting how long your wait will be and sending you text messages letting you know where you are in the queue. So you can register when you arrive and then go run some other errands if there is a long way. Probably a good plan to fit your visit to the DMV into an outing with a couple of other downtown errands. At least that worked very well for me today when I learned that I had a 90-minute wait after I registered.,5

"Done over by employee! First of all there was only two people working the window and it took us 30 min to get to the initial window to get a ticket. Told the lady my wife and I are transferring our DLs and gave her both our documents. She went over both our documents and gave us a waiting number. Waited two hours for our number then the same lady processed my wife's then told me I needed my own separate waiting number and she had forgotten to give me one, so I'd have to take a new number and wait in line again. I said I can't wait another 2 hours because I have to take my wife to work shortly. She still refused to process me. Didn't even apologize. I said fine give me the number and I have to drop my wife off and at least that will kill ~45 minutes of the wait. Then she said oh well I can't give you the ticket if you're leaving the site, you have to stay here the entire time. I was infuriated but I kept my composure. I couldn't stand to see her face again after doing me over like that so I went to the Bonny Oaks location and was in and out in 20 minutes despite there being  more customers waiting.

2+ hour wait
Clerk lady was gonna make me wait a second 2+ hours due to her own error

Then how is it you can reject a file for saying ""will begin dissolution and the last day of business is MM,DD,YYYY"" when you are requiring it to say ""the business has been dissolved on MM,DD,YYYY. It clearly states the last day of business on the articles of dissolution.",2

"Did not have a great experience here today. This is going to be long, but it's certainly complicated..

This part isn't this office's fault, but explains the set up for the issue I needed help with. I moved from my previous address to my current one in November 2018. At that time, I had already paid my vehicle tags and tax in August 2018. After updating my driver’s license in person with my new address upon moving, I also used the DMV’s online services to update my vehicle location from the old address to my new address and requested a new registration card for my vehicle with the changes.

However, the vehicle location was never properly updated in the DMV system. I noticed when my husband’s renewal notice came for his vehicle, his information was properly documented to be charging him the correct taxes for our new location in Orange County.

Fast forward to today - I went to the Carrboro Plate Agency to renew for 2021, to be sure to make the correct changes in person, as the DMV paperwork suggests. The person at the desk gave me a hard time, stating that I ‘lived in Orange County still, so the information on the form is correct.’ I told her it could not be, as I now live in a different area of the county. They charged me the same anyway and sent me on my way.

I called the tax office immediately after leaving. The tax office confirmed that the changes I was asking for were correct and that all they would have needed to do in the plate office is update the vehicle location to charge the correct amount.

I would have had to speak with the tax office to rectify my overpayment for 2019 and 2020, but it would have been nice to get this settled for 2021 before swiping my card. I now have to wait for a refund from the tax office.

They were otherwise nice and things moved quickly, but lesson learned and I will be going elsewhere or completing renewal online next time.",1
"Did not feel safe in their office. They had no plexiglass shields, customers were too close at the windows, one worker wasn't wearing a mask. The only reason I gave them 2 stars instead of 1 is they did answer questions--not in a friendly way though at all.",2
"Did not expect such a pleasant experience at the Jersey City DMV! I had an appointment scheduled for 11:05, arrived at 10:50 as requested by the automated system, and was out by 11:20. The security guards and people behind the counters were all kind (also unexpected!)

My understanding of the process is that everyone in the same appointment time slot waits outside in line until the time of appointment. Then security confirms your appointment, and you get sent to the ID check counter. For my registration renewal I just needed my driver's license and form BA-49. From there you receive a number and wait until it is called.",5

I'm literally scared to drive over several bridges, like the 495 double-decker bridge that crosses the Merrimack near the North Andover/Lawrence line.  With the condition of your roads, and Boston big dig history, it seems like only a matter of time before one of your bridge collapses and several vehicles plunge into a river.

I'll update my review if and when I receive my plates, but right now I'm feeling super uncomfortable due to the fact that they don't answer phones, and don't return calls when a voice mail is left. (multiple).

The person was polite, however this doesn't change the fact that I had to drive there after leaving several messages with no return call. Really wanted to have a great experience with this service.

I did eventually receive my paperwork - however I do not understand why on day 1 that I paid, they didn't fill out the paperwork for an out of state title. They literally acted like it was a surprise 9 days later.

Next year I'm going to AAA. :)",2

Couldn't help me because I didn't have an appointment. Make an appointment if you want to get anything done.,1
Couldn’t have been better. Just moved here out of state and needed to register my car to TN. I went around 9 am and waited in line for a few minutes then I was out 5-minutes later with my new plates and registration. Very organized and fast!,5
"Could’ve been better if it were a successful visit. I made an appointment online but it was not effective. I made an appointment for the morning of the 8/18/21, when I showed up-I was told that although the online system allows you to make an appointment. The system will kick it out. The day/time not be what you set it for. The online system will change your appointment time/date to what’s your actual appointment!!! The only appointment which is valid is the one you receive via email confirmation. This was disheartening & a waste of time due to the inconvenience of  driving from the Benton area to get here. BE AWARE!! THE ONLY APPOINTMENT THATS VALID IS THE ONE YOU GET VIA EMAIL CONFIRMATION. Don’t make the same mistake as me🥲 A 5 minute visit which could have been taken care of (especially since she told me one person didn’t show). All DMV experiences have to be bad but…",1

Corrupt to the max! They don't fix the potholes in the roads. When your car gets damaged from their lack of road maintenance they don't want to pay up. Your tax payer dollars at work!,1
"Corrupt abuse of power. Accidentally gave temporary IFTA license to an officer at the port. When she came back to tell me it was expired, I tried to give my actual license and she wouldn’t take it. Probably because she would have to redo paperwork. Instead gave me a $270 citation plus $50 reinstatement fee. All for being understandably nervous with an offstandish, angry, power hungry officer. The only way to contest is in person on trial. They obviously know this will cost more in losses revenue and travel expenses for an out of state carrier. So, obviously a money grab situation. Will avoid VA travel as much as possible",1

They must be getting a percentage on this or they wouldn't make more of a fuss about it than the State employees at the annex. Save your self their fees and a load of frustration and don't go there.

She said, they don't have phone number.  Asked for supervisor,  said they will call back in 24-48 hrs.  Exactly what good does that do?   During covid and instead of handling problems over phone, they insist you come in and wait forever to get no one who has an answer.

"Business owner is completely unprofessional. After looking at the price of my bill of sale for a car my uncle gifted me for graduation, she told me to “get out” and refused service because there’s “no way someone would sell me a 2014 for that price” when I repeatedly explained it was a “gift” from a family member. After I demanded an explanation for why she was kicking me out of her office, she proceeded to yell loudly, in from of other clients. I pulled out my phone to document the spectical she was making and she PUSHED me out of the doorway using the door. Legally I had the right to report her to the authorities but a $5 notary wasn’t worth the stress. I wouldn’t suggest anyone use this service or patronize this business. Her office is dirty unorganized, with an unpleasant smell and it looks like she lives there.

I’m really in awe of how unprofessional she was but how she keeps and presents herself the office speaks  foe itself. 🗑",1

"Bought a vehicle and had to go here to pay the taxes.  Waited in line for about a half hour, paid 400$ for the taxes and new temp tag, now I have to wait for my new tags to come in and go back and pick them up.
I've lived in larger cities that charge a lot more tax and 100$ per year for new tags.  Also the wait would have been more around 2 hours and if you showed up an hour early in the city there is already a line around the building before they open.  So only a half hour wait after they were already open is amazing.",5

"Beware of this scam of a business. They are supposed to expedite the process but they actually just charge you to make it more complicated. The actual DMV has improved their system significantly, so this service is pointless…

Speaking of service they literally gave me someone else’s documents instead of mine. But they called me and told me not to worry, they’d send them to me by email, which they did. So i disposed of the other persons documents because there was sensitive information. Who knows where my original documents ended up… i find out during my actual appointment that the documents they emailed were not sufficient. The employees at the DMV laughed because they said this happens with this expediring service ALL THE TIME. I was scammed like many others before me.

To make things worse, they never answer the phone. So I had to go in person to explain what happened. They denied all of it, pretty much calling me a liar… even though the person who made the mistake was there, and she looked at me in the eye and denied it. Not only that, they a) Did not want to reimburse me and b) charged me again to get the documents again.

I’m a business owner, and this kind of treatment of customers is unacceptable. If you make a mistake, you correct it. Don’t call the customer a liar. It’s clear their business isn’t going well, they can’t afford to reimburse a client or absorb the cost of their mistake. Not surprising given this level of ineptitude.",1

They were incredibly helpful resolving the issues preventing me from getting my license (error on my record) when other locations just sent me on my way to try to figure it out on my own.

"Best DMV ever! Two cars to register and a license renewal. Plenty of employees to help and the gentleman who appeared to be in charge is a rock star. Basically checking people in when they arrive. Asking what they need, then checking to make sure they have all the appropriate documents and paperwork BEFORE they wait or get to a customer service person.
Genius!  Saves a lot of time and frustration for everyone. So happy with the service I received.
Thank you for the great service!",5

Best 100% professional service I recommend it 👍👍👍,5
"Besides the two ladies at the front desk, the experience was good. I was annoyed that both ladies asked if we had an appointment as if the security who checked us in was incompetent and unable to ensure they were allowing only the people who had appointments in. After meeting with them, I was immediately helped by a clerk at the window, who was friendly and knowledgeable. Overall I'll have to give them 3 stars because the DMV needs to do better in the customer service department.",3

"Being in the midst of a pandemic on top of it being a licensing agency, I assumed I would need to allow myself plenty of time to wait in line to renew my tabs. What a pleasant surprise it was when I got in and out of there within a matter of minutes and was provided excellent customer service to boot. Would 1000% recommend this agency over any other I've been to in the area.",5

Being able to renew my registration and not go to the DMV is amazing! Entire process took less than 3 minutes! You pay some extra fees but in my opinion they are worth every penny! We need more of these Kiosks. Whoever had the idea to try this should get a Nobel prize!,5

"Before leaving this review.. I have to give the employees props. They all seem and sound very friendly however the issues here are more with systems, staffing and processes. There is always a HUGE line with no ability to make an appointment. This DMV seems short staffed and the employees (though kind) seem slower than other locations. I would recommend the DMV's in Anoka county where you can make an appointment, no mask required, and they seem better staffed and quicker.",1
"Before anything else is brought up, it should be noted that the teachers genuinely want the students who attend to be informed of the rules of the road to the maximum extent possible. The importance of driving safely is stressed and it is a welcoming learning environment for all. I personally attended and was satisfied with spending the $300 it cost. It was difficult to sit through the generally boring videos and much repeated content, but the knowledge gained more than equates to the time it spent to complete the class. I would recommend this school to anyone really. Shout out to Mr. Young for being a dedicated teacher and sincerely teaching what he knows everyone on the road should know.",5
"Been waiting over an hour to register my car. At this rate I will be here another hour. Can’t do it online because I just came back to Texas from another state. The other agencies are taking appointments, and I’m sitting here probably getting delta COVID. But if I don’t do this promptly I could get a ticket.  Also, I can’t keep taking off work for multiple trips here in hopes for shorter wait times.  This is distressing considering that we are at the height of the new pandemic. Whatever Texas. I know I’m not welcome here.",1

"Been waiting 2 hours, only 1 person working. A lot of kids needing road tests and other special help. Was told I should have called ahead to make appointment. Soonest appointment is in December. Cannot believe in 2019 with all the technology we have that taxpayers are still dealing with this. You're not fixing the roads so  build some larger facilities and hire some more help. People cannot take off a whole day of work for this. Lived in the south most of my life NC is by far the least concerned with customer service, efficiency, or convenience. They know they have you by the throat and just do not care.",1
"Been using AAA for many years to help with travel plans.  I booked an hour session with my agent.  The entire time I was there, she was dealing with another client on the phone.  Also, agents that I have previously used would periodically check to see if the rates have come down.  She never did.  When I inquired about the rate, she checked and found that my cruise expense had been reduced by almost $800.000.  Had I not asked, I would have had to pay that money.  I was very disappointed with the service. I will use a different agent in the future.",2

"Because I was only turning in a form that was not necessary to wait for, it was quick. The others in there were not as fortunate. The woman at the front desk though was very personable, a lot better than the one a year ago but of course it was during the height of covid. The woman that I dealt with at the counter a year ago who processed my license renewal/real ID paperwork she was very friendly and helpful. I didn't have a choice in going last year because my license was up for renewal. So I wasn't sure what to expect this time, but everything was fine other than a lot of people in the waiting room, which I did not have to wait for since all I was doing was turning in a form. The woman at the front desk gave me a choice of waiting in line for the item or having it mailed to me, guess what I chose.",5

Be careful and check your VIN no. twice when you come here for registration of your vehicle. They have an outdated system of verification which is prone to errors. A person writes down the VIN no. from your car on a separate sheet of paper and the official then goes by that sheet of paper to enter into the system instead of comparing it to your documents. Caused me and another friend a lot of problems with insurance verification and had to go back again to correct it.,2
Be aware : they  would f up your picture really bad,1
Basically a good encounter except that the online get-in-line system didn’t work right for us. I was given number D506 and they seem to have called it before I even got there. So I probably waited an extra hour expecting my number to be called. I had to violate their signage instructing customers not to approach the window until summoned. But when they realized the error they put me at the top of the queue. On balance it worked out.,4

Update 10/28
After contacting the Travis Co Tax office on 10/18, I was finally told that they are so backed up that they had to send my information to Lubbock for processing. I told her I have a week left before I to have to go back to my local tax office to get a second extension on my temp tag and pay another $30 so I can legally drive my car!

"AVOID the West Park License Bureau:  ZERO stars should be a choice!

I used the ""waiting in line"" online check-in and only my first name was called within 10 seconds of me walking into the place. I did not realized my name had been called.  I was given paperwork to fill out as soon as I had entered which took some time.  I then WAITED, AND WAITED AND WAITED until the lady at the door realized I had been waiting and spoke with someone to help me.  Things got even WORSE when I was at the counter.  I had an extremely soft spoken female who could neither hear me because of the partition between me and her.  I could not hear her because she spoke almost in a whisper.  Due to severe season allergies I had a problem with the vision test.  I explained my situation and kept using medicated eye drops to help clear my eyes up.  The problem was not my vision.  I was asked to read a vision line which I knew was BELOW  the 20/20 line!  I have had cataract eye surgeries 2 years ago which gave me vision which is 20/25 go 20/30 (depending on how irritated my eyes get due to allergies. An elderly female who I think is the lady running this location came up to the counter to speak with me.  I explained EVERYTHING to her regarding my eye irritation.  I WAS SHOCKED to hear her ""bitchily"" inform me that I should return to my eye surgeon to ""correct"" my vision situation!!!!!  I was able to read the eye chart lines after numerous eye drops to my eyes.  After I ""passed"" the eye test I stayed at the counter and COMPLETELY read the huge informative BMV Bureau Sign that was on the wall about 10 to 12 FEET AWAY from where I was standing (see photo...sign on the RIGHT).  The elderly female asked me what I was doing....and I firmly told her I DO NOT HAVE a vision problem AND I TRUST THE SKILLED and HIGHLY RESPECTED DOCTOR who did my eye surgeries over the ""ranked"" medical amateur that she was..

"⚠️ For car registrations, I feel like this is what they do. They try to squeeze every penny out of you by never sending your sticker and forcing you to come and waste your time/money.

In 2 different years, I've done my car registration renewal online only to never receive the sticker, so I've had to come here. The clerk openly admitted that it's a common occurrence. I doubt USPS loses it that often because they don't lose most of my letter mail.

I have a theory that they never send it and force you to come here or your local tax office. By coming here, I have to pay for street parking. And I also have to pay $6 to get it printed.

Here's the story: I renewed it on September 20, and decided to visit the office October 8 since I never got my sticker. I figured it wouldn't take that long to deliver mail in the same state/city and I had given it plenty of time. They needed appointments which I didn't have, but still let me wait, so that's something. When I met with the clerk, she suggested that I wait a couple more weeks because my registration receipt lets me use it as proof of registration for a month. I did not trust that it would come in the mail. My first time, the clerk kindly reprinted my sticker for free. This time, it was a trainee who asked her manager and her manager instructed her to charge me the reprint fee of $6.50.

My options were:

1. Wait 2 weeks for rest of my 30 days they give you to use your receipt as proof of registration and risk having to pay for parking and coming back here and get my sticker reprinted for free.

2. Pay $6.50 for a reprint of my sticker and not waste the time and $2 I spent on parking to come here.

I chose to pay the $6.50 and not wait for the sticker which wasn't guaranteed to come. I was already here to finish an errand - why have to find time to come back?

Guess what? It's November and I never received the promised sticker in the mail anyway so I'm glad I paid the $6.50 and got it done.",1

"As the manager of this business, it has been a tough time during the Covid-19 Pandemic.  As a small business, we have definitely had our challenges with offering consistent hours, working with a variety of unusual customer needs and keeping our staff and customers safe while operating.  We work hard to assist customers with vehicle registrations and appreciate the thousands of satisfied customers that have registered their vehicles with us throughout the years.  Every once in a while we cannot provide a customer with service that meets their expectations, and that does concern us.  Unfortunately we sometimes get a random complaint or a negative review post when that happens.  As they say, there are always two sides to every story, and we believe many of the negative posts are unfounded.  Partly, because we do not tolerate disrespectful customers nor do we complete services for customers who fail to follow the registration guidelines that are prescribed.  As we continue to assist customers with their registration needs, we strive to provide the same service that thousand before have experienced.  We thank you for your business and hope to assist you in the future.",5

"As is typical with anything relating to the State of Illinois bureaucracy, the user friendliness of the DMV facility in Joliet is VERY poor. Arrived at 7:15 to get in line outside. At 7:40, a worker comes out and herds a bunch of people to a different line on another side of the building, indicating we were all in the 65 and older line. If it was posted as such, it was poorly posted. Went from a line with 7 people left in front of me to 40+.  They are only taking 3-4 people in at a time. Got into the building at 8:30 to find out vision tests are being waived. Could have renewed my license online if that was the case, but this option wasn't provided in the letter I received.  Picture taken at 8:40, incidentally without glasses cause facial recognition used now, even though I have worn glasses since age 5 and I'm over 50, so picture is an inaccurate depiction of what I normally look like. At 9:15 AM, got called up to answer questions and sign, then to another line to pay, then to another line to pick up a Temporary ID.  They'll mail the original.  Escaped the facility at 9:31 AM. Seriously?? Over 2 1/4 hours to get a picture and renew a driver's license?? This is totally unacceptable, but I would expect nothing less from a poorly run State.

I did a walk in for stand by and they made sure that basically everyone got helped. When everything working smooth it relaxes us all. So thank you DMV employees for getting it done fast and friendly. You took a stressful experience and made it pretty painless.",5

"As an employee of the State myself, I would stay couple minutes extra to conduct and finish the business for any resident and what they might need...I arrived at the RMV at about 4:25PM for an urgent matter, and the employee there did not take my issue seriously to fix it in the last 5 minutes he had...So it was disappointing for me to see such unnprofessional way of handling things...I compared that with what I saw in Germany, Poland, and Sweden where I visited and I thought that there is way more time that we need to be as professional and as responsible to meet the need of the public!",1
"As an avid classic car collector I am in need of title services about every few months.  I always skip the Federal Way location to come here to see Shelley.  My transactions are sometimes complicated with out of state titles and such.  She is a veteran and knows what documents we need to process to get things done.
I had tried to go to FW a couple of times when I was in a hurry. NO HELP and ALL ATTITUTE in that building.  I feel like the FW location is full of employees who HATE THEIR JOB/LIFE and want to make sure you know it!  Look at the reviews of the FW location and see for yourself.
Trust me, drive the extra 10-15 minutes and come to Fife!  You'll thank me later for it.",5

Before coming to IDA, I was really anxious about driving and couldn't imagine being comfortable enough getting behind the wheel. Thanks to my instructor, Joyce, I was able to overcome my fear, properly learn all the fundamentals/skills, and gain confidence while driving. She was extremely informative, patient with my progress, and always encouraging me to do my best. At every lesson, she always took the time to thoroughly explain and answer all my questions without any judgment. I'm extremely thankful to have attended IDA and received lessons from such an amazing and caring instructor like Joyce!",5

Arrived here at 8:54am and waited in line until 9am when they opened up. All I needed to do was turn in my NC license plate and get a receipt. The staff was so friendly and extremely helpful when I asked a couple questions. The line was so fast that I was only there for 10 minutes. I'm so happy that I came here to get this done and now I don't have to worry about turning in my plate anymore.,5

I offered to drive over and bring over additional proof during her appointment time, but it was refused by staff, and despite there being an open 11AM appointment on the website, the staff refused to allow us to book that appointment time to take care of things.

"Amazing food!! Definitely the best we’ve had on our trip - and so reasonably priced! The music and outdoor vibe is fun. We had shrimp tacos and a chicken wrap. Both so yummy.
Reasoning for the loss of one star - It’s right next to a busy street so it is a bit noisy. Because of the open atmosphere, we did have a lady smoking in our face a few times. Servers were teens who were totally oblivious and it took a while to get a menu BUT the food was SO worth it.
Heads up for travelers, most of the staff only speaks Spanish.",4

"After recently getting married I called around to at least a couple dozen tag agencies to see if I needed an appointment to update my driver's license with my new last name. Only a select few were accepting walk-ins and all others were booked out passed May. The general consensus was people were showing up as early as 6am before agencies were opening, just to wait in line. This tag agency is accepting walk-in's. I arrived at 6am with one other person in front of me. We both waited in our vehicles until the 3rd vehicle showed up around 640am. By 730, there were approximately 20 people in line. The hours listed on the door showed they opened at 830, but an older gentleman opened the door at 730 and asked us all to come inside and fill out a piece of paper, including our phone number, so they could call when it was our turn. They told the first (10-15?) people to stick around and they'd help us in the next hour. Being second in line, I was out of there by 815. By that time, people trickling in were filling out the ""call sheet"" and being told it would be about 3-4pm before they'd be called back in. There were 2 ladies and 2 gentleman working behind the counter. They all seemed to have great attitudes, seemed happy to be at work, and were helpful.  (The older gentleman said at one point a lady showed up at 3am to wait, and another lady basically camped out overnight a few nights ago, just to give you an idea on what the line might look like if you arrive at their 830 opening time)",5

"Absolutely God awful. It is inexcusable for a mandatory state/government ran recourse to be so horribly ran. Two, maybe three people work here a day, they have zero interest in their jobs, and have complete disregard for the people they're serving. This is a embarrassment to the city, and anyone who's name is tied to this place.  I can't even count the amount of solutions the people in line came up with the fix the major issues that hundreds of people deal with every week. Contact government officials and bring up these easily solved problems.",1

"100% recommended coming here. Their customer service was awesome. Had the best experience. From taking my written exam to the road test, Mrs. Roxana was there to help me. I Did not know how to drive and since the first day Mrs.Roxana let me operate the car. She was really sweet and patient with me, always guiding me and encouraging me. I was scared of driving but Mrs.Roxana made me feel confident in myself. This driving school made getting my license an easy process.",5

"10/10 would recommend IDA! I took both my permit written exam and my driving test here.

I took 10 hours class and it was just perfect. I learned how to parallel park, back around the corner, drive on the highway (merge, enter, exit, switch lane) in no time.

Joyce is a true natural when it comes to teaching. She’s very patient, knowledgeable, and attentive. She would never yell at you. Each lesson, she would introduce a new challenge!

I will really really miss driving with Her! If you’re reading this Joyce, keep going! We need more teacher like you! ❤️",5
"10/10 The ladies here are the best. It seems like the morale here is great! As someone who works at a similar place I understand that the energy you bring into a place is the same that you will receive from the employees. It’s always better to be nice to people who work this heavily with the public.

Anna took care of me today and made sure that I got all that I needed, but all the ladies were joking and chatting with me in generally high spirits.
I highly recommend this location for people who are nice and not grumpy because of outside reasons, please don’t come just to be rude when you’re having a bad day! (Don’t say you’ll come back when the camera works better, they’ll just tell you that’s not happening anytime soon 😂 you can bring your own lighting though!)
Definitely the best tag agency in Tulsa.",5

"1 Stop Driving School is great, pain and simple. I'd say they're the best driving school in the state. Possibly the country. I took the 30 hour, Driver Education online and it's well informed and easy to learn. Not once was I bored, especially with the videos they provided. It's professional and informative. They cover everything you need to know from traffic signs, to learning personal factors like alcohol, even to how to make informed choices. I would like to Thank Melinda for everything, she's a very kind and welcoming lady. Did I mention helpful too?!  100 percent recommend this any course in this school!",5

"1 star because my time coming up in the 90s in Lexington, was grand.  I looked forward every year to attending Micro City Government functions.  We or I...had the best time.  Yes, there was fights...but who doesn't fight.  I consider it excercise. We had food, entertainment, booths, got to get dressed up....and we ran from one end of the park or rink to work off the food and energy (fun). Therefore, once we got back home we be tired and have worked off slot of steam and frustration...then back to the books.  So the fights wasn't bad.  This program was one highlight of my teenage years.  Thank you to all who had something to do with it.",1
1 is the lowest star I could give. Just spoke with an operator and she was rude and not trying to help me whatsoever. I had to painfully drag the answers out of her.,1

"***This review was written to prove a relative wrong

The WI department of transportation does not show enough support for fuel-efficient vehicles. These said vehicles are more sustainable for the environment. The WI dept of transportation lacks support for these vehicles, especially compared to other states. For example, it's neighboring state Illinois has a dept of transportation that does show much more support for these fuel-efficient vehicles. Fuel-efficient vehicles are important considering how climate change is having impacts all over the world. Therefore, WI dept of transportation should show more support for fuel-efficient vehicles.",1

Parking: it’s bad. You can look for street parking, but it’s basically non-existent. I parked in the library deck down the street. It was a 5 minute walk and I paid $6.

Best DMV experience ever! Super quick and easy. I arrived 15 minutes before my scheduled appointment. I walked in and a woman at the door checked for my appointment and asked for my paperwork. She reviewed my paperwork, did my eye exam, and printed out my ticket in less than 5 minutes. I had barely sat down before I was called up to the desk. The woman that did my DL application was polite and efficient. She explained everything clearly and registered me to vote as well. I was in and out before my appointment time even passed.

I would recommend an appointment if you have time, but you don’t need one. There were maybe 3 or 4 people at the DMV on the Tuesday morning I went.",5

"** Renewal of Driver License**
Go anywhere but here. Admiral Tag Agency is the most unprofessional agency I’ve ever dealt with.

I believe her name is Mrs.Walker (gray short hair) who was renewing licenses. She did not work in order of her sign-in list and allowed  her family member to cut the entire line in addition to allowing three different people to come back in to be helped immediately, even if she called there name more than 45 minutes earlier and they weren’t there. I recommend management look at the cameras and observe everything that took place on September 13th,2021.  I also took a picture of the sign- in sheet that reflects  she was skipping people who were waiting due to her highlighting off each customer after they had been served. I would be happy to send the picture to management. The tag agency should require a certain quantity of words be typed in a minute for this position. The gray headed lady went home and was replaced with someone who was incredibly more efficient and knew how to get through a list in order. If this is your only option pray you get a fair and efficient person behind the desk.",1

Also, she offered me appointments for the next day and the day after which I could not accommodate. When I went online to schedule an appointment the soonest date was 12 days later.
